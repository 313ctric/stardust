Thanks a lot to everyone who took part in our speed programming competition yesterday evening, sponsored by [Red Gate](http://www.red-gate.com/). I was really surprised with the number of people who had a solution to all four problems\! The winner was David Purser, who solved all four problems, solving question 3 in O(n) time, who gets the fabulous prize\! Most people who solved question x gave the minimax style solution, however a special mention goes to Alex Best who came up with the max flow style solution although unfortunately didn't have time to implement it. All solutions emailed to me are uploaded [here](http://ruth.uwcs.co.uk/progcomp/271113/solutions/).

Thanks to everyone who took part\!
