Welcome, freshers, to UWCS. I'm sending out a newsletter that you'll receive by email (or can view on the website if not a member) later in the week detailing what's going on in the next fortnight or so.

For this week, at least, we have the first gaming session on Friday. Details in the 'Events' section of the website, as always\!

You can join the society at your leisure here: <http://www.warwicksu.com/societies/computing/>
