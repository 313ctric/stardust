Greetings CompSoc\!

I hope you all enjoyed your holidays. If you didn't, why not come along to one of our gaming or programming events and cheer yourself up?

This term we have our usual weekly pub socials on Mondays, weekly programming workshops, and weekly Friday night gaming as usual alongside XING. Event details for this week further down.

Signups are open for the first LAN of term in week 4, another LAN to come week 8.

We also expect at least a couple extra academic talks, and are arranging a trip to the National Museum of Computing, details to come soon.

I shall be making a clothes order of UWCS branded stuff in the next couple of weeks. If you would like a UWCS branded shirt or hoodie with or without a name or gamertag of some form (retaining capitalisation) or whatever then please either email me, tell me at pub, or tell me at gaming. I shall likely be able to start collecting payments for this at gaming this week. I shall place an event for the order on the website when I know the deadline and prices, and send out another email with the details.

This term we're holding the Annual General Meeting where we will elect our new exec as well as decide any major changes to the society, including whether to add or remove exec positions. The AGM will be held roughly half way through the term. The current positions and roles they entail are listed in the news item for the previous AGM: http://uwcs.co.uk/details/1587/  
Additionally exec duties include filling slots on the LAN rotas, attending (roughly) weekly meetings whenever possible, and to remain active on the \#exec UWCS IRC channel. More information will come about the AGM, until then if you would like to know any more about the positions you can ask the respective exec on IRC or by email: http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/contact/
