This evening we ran our first speed programming competition of the term. This was the first of a series of fortnightly programming competitions we are running, which will hopefully have a sponsored prize for the best overall competitor at the end of term\! Stay tuned for more details on this.

The competition was won by Thomas Kiley, a third year Discrete Maths student who managed to successfully answer the first three questions and had a go at the fourth. In second place with Richard Townsend who got question 1 right and nearly almost the next 2. Special mentions go out to Matt Dawson, whose answers in Java had a fantastic UI, and to Estel for his enterprise answer to question 1 (code [here](https://github.com/esteluk/compsoc-progcomp-1-q1/)).

The questions and solutions can be found [here](http://www.ruth.uwcs.co.uk/progcomp/151013).
