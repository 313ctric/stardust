<p>Week 5 has arrived, so here&#x27;s some more news for you!</p>

<!-- more -->

Salut\! Week 5 is somehow already upon us, so it's time for another newsletter\!

### **Meet our Secretary\!**

Hi there, I'm Harry, the newly appointed secretary for UWCS\! From now on, I'll be the (lack of a) mind behind these newsletters, hopefully following on where Josh left off, and will also be handling some of the administrative tasks behind the scenes. I enjoy the odd game, mostly sticking to racing and open-world games (RDR2 being a personal favourite), but I'm always open to trying new things\! Hopefully, I'll see lots of you at our future events\!

### **LAN Recap\!**

Thank you to everyone who came to our first LAN since the pandemic began which was held from Friday to Sunday\! It was great to see lots of faces there, both new and old\! Looking ahead, the next LAN is currently set to be in week 7 of this term (19th-21st Nov), so keep your eyes peeled for more information on that coming soon if you're interested\!

### **Pub\!**

Sometimes cooking is too much effort, so why not join us on our weekly trip to the pub instead\! We'll be meeting outside DCS at 6:30 tonight, or you can meet us at The Phantom Coach at about 7:00 for a meal and some chat\!

### **Friday Night Gaming**

Come join us in the ground floor of DCS - we'll put out our range of consoles and games for you to come and enjoy. We'll have Steam up and running, and Gaming Get is now also working with our collection of DRM-free games.

As this event is in-person, we'll be asking people to follow the following safety precautions:

  - All attendees will have their temperature checked and be asked to sign in on arrival for tracing purposes in the event of a positive case.
  - Social distancing and mask-wearing will be strongly encouraged.
  - Please have the NHS-Covid19 app installed and active on your phone if possible.
  - We encourage you to take a lateral flow test before and after the event.
  - If you test positive, display ANY Covid-19 symptoms or at all feel unwell, please do not attend the event\!

If you have any questions about the event, or test positive for Covid-19 in the days following the event, please get in touch with a member of the exec, either through Discord DMs or via email at <exec@uwcs.co.uk>
