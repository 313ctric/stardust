Society membership rolls over at 11:59pm August 31st, so remember to **renew your memberships** if you want to keep informed about our events. You will need to pay the Society Federation fee, then joining us is free! (the soc fed fee allows you to join any and all societies).

I have been told I should inform you all what we have to offer next year, so I shall do so in the form of a poorly adapted quote:

> Nobody expects the Computing Inquisition! Our chief weapon is friday night gaming ... friday night gaming and academic talks ... academic talks and friday night gaming ...... our two weapons are academic talks and friday night gaming ... and weekly socials ..... Our three weapons are academic talks, friday night gaming, and weekly socials ... and an almost fanatical devotion to Blahaj ...... Our four, no ... amongst our weapons .... amongst our weaponry ... are such elements as academic talks, friday night gaming .... I'll come in again.

...

> Nobody expects the Computing Inquisition! Amongst our weaponry are such diverse elements as academic talks, friday night gaming, weekly socials, and an almost fanatical devotion to Blahaj, and nice blue & yellow programming socks - oh damn!

Anyway, a bit more informatively:

The University of Warwick Computing Society (UWCS) is open to anyone with an interest in anything computer-y! We are a welcoming community for all skill levels with close ties with our department and a wide network of industry and alumni. We hold many academic events each term, including talks from industry and fellow students (as lightning talks), programming challenges, and courses - this term both a Rust course and cross-society Python course! If gaming is more your thing, we hold Friday Night Gaming weekly, and weekend long LANs twice each term. To complement all this hard work, we hold plenty of socials also: weekly pub trips, nights out, and many one-off special events!
