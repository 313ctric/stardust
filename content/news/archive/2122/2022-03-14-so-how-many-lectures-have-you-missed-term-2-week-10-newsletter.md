<p data-block-key="3ptx7">Heya! Welcome to the final newsletter of the term. Unfortunately, the stress isn&#x27;t quite over yet! We&#x27;ve got something for everyone this week.</p>

<!-- more -->

Hey everyone\! Welcome to the final newsletter of the term. Unfortunately, the stress isn't quite over yet - some deadlines stretch past the term - but it's the last week of dragging yourself to lectures for a while\! Whether you're stressing over WAFFLES, frying your brain over coding up that functional assignment, want to celebrate not having to talk to your software engineering group ever again, or collapsing after those project presentations, or have literally no idea what I'm talking about, we've got a little something for everyone this week\!

This is my final newsletter, with our new secretary Owen taking over when we return after the Easter break\!

### **üßá WAFFLE Wednesday**

#### *Wednesday 16th, 4:00pm @ CS0.01*

It will be Wednesday. There will be [WAFFLES](https://uwcs.co.uk/media/images/waffle_3.original.jpg). There will be waffles. Although they may be free, you will not be. That is all I can say.

### **üì£ Publicity Officer + Flag/Mascot/Motto Elections (+üçï)**

#### *Friday 18th, 7:00pm @ Department of Computer Science - Atrium*

Just before Friday Night Gaming, it's time for some elections\! We'll be voting in a new publicity officer - if you wish to nominate yourself, you can email `returning-officer@uwcs.co.uk` with your name and a short, 50 word description that will be displayed in the voting portal. You can also just turn up and nominate yourself on the day if you want\! There's a similar process for the flag, mascot and motto votes - send in your nominations, and then we can vote on the best.

We'll be using our own voting platform, <https://vote.uwcs.co.uk/> - you'll be able to vote just after everyone's been asked questions, and you have 5 days to do so\!

### **üéÆ Friday Night Gaming**

#### *Friday 18th, 8pm-12am, Department of Computer Science*

Join us until midnight in DCS for a stress-free night of fun\! We've got a wide range of consoles, from retro to modern, including classics such as Rock Band and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Not only that, but our very own Valve Index VR setup, with a wide selection of games (not just Beat Saber)\! Also just a chill place to hang out, and take a break from that coursework you've been grinding for the past few days...

*( As this event is in-person, we ask that you follow the safety precautions outlined at* [*https://uwcs.co.uk/covid-19/*](https://uwcs.co.uk/about/covid-19/) *)*

That's all from me\! Wishing you a great week,

Harry (he/him)
