Don't worry if you can't make it in person - we'll be hanging around in the Discord and streaming some events, so there are still ways to get involved\! Speaking of the events, here's our schedule for the weekend:

**Note:** Friday Night Gaming will take place at LIB2, instead of our usual location in the Department of Computer Science.

Hopefully, there's something on the schedule you're interested in - we'd recommend dropping by in the evenings if you've not got much time. We'll have our VR setup along with console and tabletop games, so if you don't have a PC/Laptop you'll still be able to take part in these.
