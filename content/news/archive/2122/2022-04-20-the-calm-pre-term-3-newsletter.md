<!-- more -->

Wow, that break really flew by huh? Quite a lot has happened since the last newsletter, so I think it's time for a little speedrun...

## 🤝 Introducing our new exec team\!

#### 🔗[Instagram Post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cck9zBjsGVL/)

Another year, another exec - we've expanded our team to 20(\!), and hope to provide you with a lot more high-quality, useful events. Want to get to know us? We've got a post up of who we are and what we do on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cck9zBjsGVL/) page\! If you aren't already, make sure you're following us there for more frequent updates and stories.

## 🎓 Revision Sessions - CS130 & CS260

To help with the most painful modules of this exam period, we'll be starting to run help sessions for you all\! Where you can get help on questions, content, and more. We're kicking this off with:

#### ***CS260 Algorithms*** **🕒** 3-5pm, Saturday 📍 [MS.03](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=2502)

We'll be invading a 2nd year revision room for a bit to go through some problems and concepts, mainly focusing on the back half of the module. After that, we'd be happy to answer individual questions that people are having trouble with.

#### ***CS130 Maths for CS 1*** 🕑 2-6pm, *Monday* 📍 [MB0.08](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=15898)

We'll be holding a slightly longer drop-in session for 1st years, where we'll be around to go through requested concepts, help out with questions (the 2019 past paper is quite tricky in places), and give a place for you to collaborate\!

## 🍻 The Pub Before the Storm

#### 🕕 *6pm, Sunday Wk 0* 📍 [*Dirty Duck*](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=2202)

Need one final break from revising for those week 1 exams? Join us in the [Dirty Duck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN22-jwS8Rw) from 6pm this Sunday for some good food, good company, and a good time.

Note: This is usually on Monday, but has been pulled forward to Sunday because of early exam dates. <sub><sup>(one of the rare times I enjoy being 3rd year)</sup></sub>

## 👕 We have Merch now\!
