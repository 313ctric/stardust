### **LAN Recap\!**

Thank you so much to everyone that came along to the LAN over the weekend - we hope you enjoyed your time, whether you dropped by for the occasional event or were there most of the weekend\! There won't be any more LANs this term, but we'll be back next term for more\!

### üçî **Join us at the Pub, RIGHT NOW\! (50% Off Food)**

#### *\[Week 8\] Monday 22nd, 6:30pm @ DCS, then 7pm @ The Phantom Coach*

It's Monday, so you know what that means - we're off to the pub\! There's another reason to join us this week, because **all the main meals are 50% off**. Not only do you not have to make something to eat, but you also get to do it on the cheap. As usual we'll be meeting outside DCS at 6:30 tonight, or if you prefer, you can meet us at The Phantom Coach at 7:00 instead. Hope to see ya there\!

### **üèÜ UWCS Challenge**

#### *\[Week 8\] Wednesday 24th, 5pm-8pm, CS0.01, Department of Computer Science*

In case you aren't already aware, we've decided to hold a little **programming contest** this week\! Come on down to tackle some cool problems, whether that's **on your own or in a group of three**, and hey, maybe you'll even win one of our prizes\! The problems are spread across a **range of difficulties,** to try and make sure you'll enjoy it (and maybe even learn something new) no matter how skilled you'd consider yourself.

**üçï Free pizza** will also be provided for you, about halfway through the event. So there's even more reason to come along...

*( As this event is in-person, we ask that you follow the safety precautions outlined at* <span id="2838">*https://uwcs.co.uk/covid-19/*</span> *)*

### üéÆ **Friday Night Gaming - Now with VR\!**

#### *\[Week 8\] Friday 26th, 7pm-12am, Department of Computer Science*

Come join us in the ground floor of DCS, as we kick our feet up and relax by playing some games. We'll be putting out our range of consoles, and Steam is up and running for you to use your library, but we also have our very own GamingGet software where you can download and play a bunch of DRM-Free games, no login required. Top it all off, we'll have VR available too\!

*( As this event is in-person, we ask that you follow the safety precautions outlined at* <span id="2838">*https://uwcs.co.uk/covid-19/*</span> *)*

### **‚ö° Lightning Talks**

#### *\[Week 9\] Wednesday 1st, 6pm-7:30pm, "Somewhere on Campus", and Livestreamed to* [*Discord*](https://discord.uwcs.uk)*.*

Surprise\! We've got a final set of lightning talks for you this term. Better yet, it's going to be in-person\! The setup is simple - three members of the society, each given 15-20 minutes to talk about a cool Computing-related thing\! Then, you'll be able to ask some questions. We'll update you with more information later in the week, including short descriptions of each talk - so keep an eye out on our Discord\!

**üçï** And yes, there will of course be **free pizza**. Personally, I think that every lecture at Warwick should have free pizza.
