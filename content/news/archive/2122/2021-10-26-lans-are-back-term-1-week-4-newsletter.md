Bonjour\! Week 4 is here and it's time for some more news from us\! (although admittedly not a lot this week)

### **Meet our Gaming Coordinator\!**

Hey I'm Habib, the current üéÆ Gaming Coordinator for UWCS. I'm happy for you to use any pronouns but prefer they/them üòÉ. I help run the weekly friday night gaming and our termly LANs. You can usually find me playing GeoGuessr or F1 2021 at Friday Night Gaming but I'm also a fan of Valorant and other first person shooters. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions or any feedback for any of our events and I'll be sure to help everyone have a better experience\!

### **LAN: Back From The Dead\!**

#### *Friday 10pm - Sunday 6pm, LIB2*

It's finally back - our first in-person LAN since the pandemic started is happening **this weekend** from Friday 10pm until Sunday 6pm in LIB2\! Don't know where LIB2 is? Check out the campus map here: <https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=5753>

If you are interested in coming, **please sign up at the following link:** [**https://warwick.gg/events/lan-back-from-the-dead-2021**](https://warwick.gg/events/lan-back-from-the-dead-2021) - you can sign in with your UWCS account here if you are a member and also reserve a seat\! Please still do this even if you aren't planning to be around the whole time - this ensures you have a space reserved if you are bringing a desktop. We cannot guarantee entry if spaces are taken, so please book to avoid disappointment\!

You can find all the information you need at that link\! Can't attend in person? Don't worry\! We'll also be around in Discord so feel free to join us there too.

**Please note:** as this is on Friday, our usual gaming will start as usual in DCS, although scaled back. Once LAN is set up, we'll be packing down DCS and moving over there\!

As this event is in-person, we'll be asking people to follow the following safety precautions:

  - All attendees will have their temperature checked and be asked to sign in on arrival/out when they leave for tracing purposes in the event of a positive case.
  - Social distancing and mask wearing will be strongly encouraged.
  - Hand sanitiser and wipes will be available and their continued use will be strongly encouraged.
  - Please have the NHS-Covid19 app installed and active on your phone if possible.
  - We encourage you to take a lateral flow test before and after the event.
  - If you test positive, display ANY Covid-19 symptoms or at all feel unwell, please do not attend the event\!

If you have any questions about the event, or test positive for Covid-19 in the days following the event, please get in touch with a member of the exec, either through Discord DMs or via email at <exec@uwcs.co.uk>
