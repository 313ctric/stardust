<p data-block-key="3ptx7">Term 2 is nearly over, and our Bletchley Park trip is just around the corner!</p>

<!-- more -->

Hello everyone\! It's the final stretch to the end of term now, and we've got another set of Lightning Talks, as well as our trip to Bletchley Park this week\!

### 

### **‚ö° Lightning Talks**

#### *\[Week 9\] Wednesday 9th Mar, 2pm-3:30pm, CS1.04,* [Teams](https://go.uwcs.uk/lightningtalks-mar2022) & Discord

It's the return of Lightning Talks on Wednesday - three speakers, each with their own 15 minute talk:

  - ***A Contained Introduction to Docker*** - What is Docker? Why is Docker? How is Docker? At least two of these questions will be answered over the course of this talk, along with some demos and information on running multi-container applications.
  - ***Synthetic Data Generation for Machine Learning*** - Scalable User Simulator (SUS) is a framework for replicating human behaviour in generating system and network logs. We'll look at why it's needed, the architecture behind the project, and maybe a rant about Windows Automation APIs.
  - ***Introduction to 3D Printing*** - An overview of the history, different types and general processes involved with 3D printing. And, how you can get your own stuff printed for free\!

We'll be holding these in-person (in CS1.04), along with streams to Teams and our Discord server, so if any of these interest you, come along\!

### **üéÆ Friday Night Gaming**

#### *\[Week 9\] Friday 11th Mar, 7pm-12am, Department of Computer Science*

Come join us in the ground floor of DCS, as we kick our feet up and relax by playing some games. We'll be putting out our range of consoles, and Steam is up and running for you to use your library, but we also have our very own GamingGet software where you can download and play a bunch of DRM-Free games, no login required. We now have a **second switch** available, and to top it all off, we'll have VR available too\!

*( As this event is in-person, we ask that you follow the safety precautions outlined at* [*https://uwcs.co.uk/covid-19/*](https://uwcs.co.uk/about/covid-19/) *)*

### **Bletchley Park Trip**

#### *\[Week 9\] Saturday 12th Mar, All Day, Bletchley Park and The National Museum of Computing*

We'll be having our trip to Bletchley Park and The National Museum of Computing this Saturday\! Entry costs will be covered by us, so all you'll need to pay for is transport - we'd recommend the 08:48 train from Coventry, and tickets are cheaper if you book as a group\! A rough schedule for the day is as follows:

  - 08:48 - Train sets off from Coventry Station
  - 10:00 - Arrive at Bletchley Park
  - 13:15 - Lunch
  - 14:30 - Arrive at The National Museum of Computing
  - 17:13 - Train sets off from Bletchley Station
