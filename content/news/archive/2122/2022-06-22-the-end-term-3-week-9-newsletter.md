<p data-block-key="o4r0q">The end of term is near, and many people are leaving (just like our collective sanity)</p>

<!-- more -->

All CS exams are over\! So make sure to forget as much as possible in the next few weeks in preparation for summer.

## 👕 Merch Pickup (Last Chances)

I will be holding merch pickup sessions from **1pm to 3pm Thursday in DCS**. We should\* also have pickup at FNG once again.

I am hoping to get merch handed out this week, so these will be the last major pickup sessions (and the last ping about merch). **If you are unable to collect this week, DM me to organize delivery or someone collecting on your behalf,** otherwise you risk waiting until September.

\* I'm unavailable both Friday and next week (Summer LAN, which has questions in its own right), but should be able to get another exec to do it.

## 🍻 End of Term Meal

#### 🕗 *Wednesday (Tonight) 6pm* 📍 *Turtle Bay Leamington*

*At the time of writing, 7 places remain, so get in soon if you want to go\!*

As we are coming to the end of the term, we will be hosting our weekly pub meal in a slightly fancier place: Turtle Bay (Leamington Spa).

We are planning to book a table and as such have initially opened 20 spaces. Please fill out the form below if you will be attending. Places are limited\!  
This is incredibly rushed so sorry for anyone that has already made plans. If you fill out the form but are no longer able to come please message me so we can remove you from the list.

## **🎮 Friday Night Gaming**

#### 🕗 *Friday, 8pm-12am* 📍 [*Department of Computer Science*](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=1547)

Exams are almost over, but that doesn't mean the fun can't stop. Join us until midnight in DCS for a stress-free night of fun\! We've got a wide range of consoles, from retro to modern, including classics such as Rock Band and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Not only that, but our very own Valve Index VR setup, with a wide selection of games (not just Beat Saber)\! It's also just a chill place to hang out, and have a little break from the revision grind.

## 🏃‍♂️ WASD: Speedrunning for Charity

WASD is over, and we **raised £539** for SpecialEffect\! We had some amazing runs, and even better runners (especially for tolerating our tech problems)\! Thanks to all the people who ran and contributed to the stream and organization. Thanks to the Esports Centre and Esports Society for helping so much as well. VODs will be up on YouTube soon.

Here we come WASD 2023\!
