## 🗣 Talk: Day In the Life of a Software Engineer

#### 🕕 *6pm Thusday* 📍 *Discord*

*As a software engineer, every day is different. Whether you're maintaining or creating a project, collaborating with a team or going solo, you're always learning new things. This talk discusses the challenges and rewards that come with the job.*

🎤 **About the Speaker:** Leo Riviera is a software engineer, speaker and entrepreneur, with a special focus on internal tooling. He works as a software engineer at Blum, a UK health startup, and Innovation Lead at Voxa, a consultancy and research company based in Coventry.

## 🖥 Programming Mini-Challenge

#### 🕕 *Thursday 7pm - Tuesday 7pm* 📍 Online

A small, leaderboard-based programming challenge for you all. See if you can get the best score before Tuesday evening\! The format will consist of a starter problem that you can verify your answer for, before introducing the main problem. We'll be providing £20 in Amazon Vouchers for the top scorer - good luck\!

For those 1st years who haven't completed their PDP yet <sub>(if you don't know what that is, be thankful you didn't do professional skills this year)</sub>, this will count towards it\! While we're on the subject - if you wanna count any of our other academic events for it, send the form to Keegan (`Keegan#9109` or <president@uwcs.co.uk>) to sign it off for you.

## **🎮 Friday Night Gaming**

#### 🕗 *Friday, 7pm-12am* 📍[*Department of Computer Science*](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=1547)

Join us until midnight in DCS for a stress-free night of fun\! We've got a wide range of consoles, from retro to modern, including classics such as Rock Band and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Not only that, but our very own Valve Index VR setup, with a wide selection of games (not just Beat Saber)\! Also just a chill place to hang out, and celebrate(?) your first week of exams\!

🍿 Personally, I'm just coming to sit back and enjoy some popcorn watching our new Gaming Officers set this one up\!

## ⭕ [I am a Circle](https://youtu.be/9TXFHUyxZy4?t=19)

#### 🕗 *Friday 7:30pm* 📍 [Kelsey's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dn9WJZHRPsTfSh2F7)

<sub>(If you don't understand the reference, you didn't have a childhood)</sub>

Instead of gaming, some people among us will be heading off to circle\! Whether you want to drink to celebrate or forget, our social secretaries sure have the session for you\! The *theme for the circle is* ***Emoji'****s* 🙃 so dress up in your best emoji-related outfits or you may find yourself with a penalty\!

We will leave from the campus **bus interchange** at 7pm, to arrive at Kelsey's for 7:30pm.

*Note: This was initially announced as Sunday at Assembly, but is now Friday at Kelsey's.*

## 🍻 The Pub After(?) the Storm

#### 🕕 *Sunday 6pm* 📍 [Varsity](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=8812)

Join us from 6pm this Sunday for some good food, good company, and a good time\! We'll be rotating around to Varsity this week. Also, can you believe The Dirty Duck put up prices by about £1 per item? Honestly. Can someone please start a \#canceltheduck campaign on Twitter? Anyway, let's hope Varsity hasn't done the same, or we'll be getting our pitchforks out...

Note: This is usually on Monday, but has been pulled forward to Sunday because of our talk next Monday\!

## 🗣 Talk: Getting started with DevOps for your Projects

#### 📅 *Monday 6pm, Week 2* 📍[*YouTube*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1YEQkkfl2lE7os5rbUodVg)

*Improving development experience with good DevOps can help make you more productive and make it easier to collaborate with others. With the help of practical examples, I’ll show how you can make the most out of GitHub and git: fine tuning your repositories, best practices and workflows, and continuous integration and deployment. I’ll also show how to package an application as a Docker image. All of this will help you with your group or individual projects, as well your career in industry.*

Previously, Michael was a Senior Teaching Fellow at the University of Warwick, where he taught the Functional Programming and Cyber Security modules.
