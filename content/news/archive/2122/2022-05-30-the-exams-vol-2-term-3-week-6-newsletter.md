Exam Season anyone?

## 🍻 Phantom Coach Meal

#### 🕕 *Monday 6pm* 📍 [Phantom Coach](https://goo.gl/maps/5H1DGDTvTMK1L5x38)

We are returning to our old regular, the Phantom Coach\! Come along and have a bit of a laugh at the weird theming this year's software engineering exam got (and maybe a bit of a cry about the content.)

## **🎮 Friday Night Gaming**

#### 🕗 *Friday, 8pm-12am* 📍 [*Department of Computer Science*](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=1547)

Join us until midnight in DCS for a stress-free night of fun\! We've got a wide range of consoles, from retro to modern, including classics such as Rock Band and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Not only that, but our very own Valve Index VR setup, with a wide selection of games (not just Beat Saber)\! It's also just a chill place to hang out, and have a little break from the revision grind.

## 🧠 CS262 Revision Session

#### 🕗 *Saturday 2pm* 📍 [MB0.08](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=17265&project_id=1)

We have another revision session\! Let's hope we can verify your logic\! We'll mostly be going over First Order Logic, Hoare Triples, and just a bit of SAT.

## 🏃‍♂️ WASD Submissions Closed

Submissions are now closed and the schedule will be prepared in the next week. WASD is shaping up to be quite the event, with quite the variety of games and runs, so mark the 18th-19th June in your calendar\!

## 👕Merch Update

The programming socks arrived literally as I was writing this\! Everything else will be a bit longer yet, so we will wait until we have a few things waiting for collection to give them out -- unless you desperately want a pair, if so DM me EricTheLemur\#8899. (the socks were ordered early in the case of delayed shipping from China)

Looking Ahead...
