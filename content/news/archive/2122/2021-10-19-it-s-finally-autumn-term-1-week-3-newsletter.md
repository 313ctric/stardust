<p>It&#x27;s week 3, the leaves are changing colour and it&#x27;s getting cooler! This can only mean one thing - it&#x27;s time for some more news!</p>

<!-- more -->

Hey hey\! Welcome to week 3, where we still have some great news lined up for you\!

### **Meet our Women's Officer\!**

Hey. I'm Ella. Women's Officer and goose overlord. I'm a second year doing Computer Science and am always happy to take recommendations for events to run or ways I can help make more people feel comfortable as a part of UWCS :) More about me? Idk. Stuff. I play Valorant currently but also sometimes play CS:GO, Minecraft and Civ 6 recently.

Octoplushies are cool. You should get one. That's all from me now :)

### **While you're reading this...**

Psst\! *We're looking for a Secretary to join* as an official member of the exec team for this academic year. Some of the responsibilities: helping to write the newsletter you're reading right now, organising, and recording the minutes of meetings, helping to book rooms for in-person events, and also sorting out some merch orders\! Unfortunately, due to SU regulations, you won't have voting privileges at meetings (this is known as "exec without portfolio") - but we don't have a rigid structure either, so you're more than welcome to help out with other aspects of the society. You need to be an official member of the society in order to take up this role.

If this does sound like something you're interested in, please send an email to <exec@uwcs.co.uk> and let us know a bit about yourself, why you'd be good for the role, and what you'd bring to the exec team.

The deadline is **23.59pm** on **21st October**, and we'll aim to pick someone by the end of this week. We look forward to hearing from you\!

### **Friday Night Gaming**

Come join us in the ground floor of DCS - we'll put out our range of consoles and games for you to come and enjoy. We'll have Steam up and running, and Gaming Get is now also working with our collection of DRM-free games.

As this event is in-person, we'll be asking people to follow the following safety precautions:

  - All attendees will have their temperature checked and be asked to sign in on arrival for tracing purposes in the event of a positive case.
  - Social distancing and mask wearing will be strongly encouraged.
  - Please have the NHS-Covid19 app installed and active on your phone if possible.
  - We encourage you to take a lateral flow test before and after the event.
  - If you test positive, display ANY Covid-19 symptoms or at all feel unwell, please do not attend the event\!

If you have any questions about the event, or test positive for Covid-19 in the days following the event, please get in touch with a member of the exec, either through Discord DMs or via email at <exec@uwcs.co.uk>

### **Socials happened\!**

#### It's a message from Ella\!

In case you missed it, last Thursday was our first successful Women and Non-binary meet. Thank you so much to those of you who came. And for those of you who couldn‚Äôt make it or weren‚Äôt aware, don‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôre going to try and organise something again for later this term.

I hope you all enjoyed meeting others on the course.

Feel free to let me (<womens-officer@uwcs.co.uk> or @SH4D0WR1D3R\#7857) know how you found the event and how we could improve. We would love to meet more of you\!

For now though, enjoy this photo from the event.
