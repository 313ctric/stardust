<p>Just a few more days to go in term 1 before a well-deserved holiday - check out the final term 1 newsletter here!</p>

<!-- more -->

Hello everyone\! We've made it to week 10, and there's a nice break from work on the horizon - but for now, here's this weeks newsletter\!

### **EGM Results**

As many of you will have seen, we recently held an Extraordinary General Meeting to elect a new Gaming Coordinator, and also propose some constitution-changing motions. Unfortunately, the votes on both constitution-changing motions were inquorate, and so they cannot be put into action, however, the results are included below, in the format For/Against (Abstentions):

**Motion to Require the Appointment of a Standing President in the Event of Extended Absence or Resignation of the President:**

Passed 17/4 (1)

**Motion to Include the Society‚Äôs Affiliation with the British Computing Society within the Constitution:**

Passed 20/1 (1)

The election of a new Gaming Coordinator was won by Felix Bowyer, but this was also unfortunately inquorate, and so the position remains unfilled for now.

### **DCS Christmas Party Gaming\!**
