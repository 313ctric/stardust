I, for one, am totally prepared for the exam period starting next week.

## 🔥 BBQ

#### 🕗 *Monday 2:30pm* 📍 ***Now at*** [***Windmill Hill***](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=16836)

You lot sure loved the idea of this\! The days are definitely warm now, and we feel like doing a BBQ. This is going to be on campus at **Windmill Hill** on **Monday 9th at 2:30 PM**. In order to get the right amount of food we will be needing signups, which have now closed.

The ***food will be free*** (I love sponsorship money) as well as a few soft drinks. Hope to see everyone there\!
