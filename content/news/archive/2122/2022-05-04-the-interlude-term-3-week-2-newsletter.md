## **🎮 Friday Night Gaming**

Join us until midnight in DCS for a stress-free night of fun\! We've got a wide range of consoles, from retro to modern, including classics such as Rock Band and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

🍿 Personally, I'm just coming to sit back and enjoy some popcorn watching our new Gaming Officers set this one up\!

#### 🕗 *Saturday, 2pm-4pm* 📍 MB0.08 (That's MSB)

Swooping in with a session for the second years, this time we're doing something for logic and verification. Mostly nice content, but a potentially tricky exam if the 2021 paper is anything to go by... we'll be covering some topics, past paper questions, and some problems of our own. Even though the exam is still a bit away, don't miss out\!

## ⚡ Lightning Talks: Third Year Project Edition

#### 📅 *Wednesday, Week 3*

**HEY\! Did you do a third year project? Was it cool? Fancy talking about it? We want to hear from you\!**

We're planning for another round of lightning talks - fast-paced 15 minute talks directly society members\! And this time, we want to help out the second years in their search for a third year project. What better way to do that than give them an insight into some existing projects? Whether you did something practical, theoretical, or somewhere in-between, we want to hear from you\!

➡️ *If you're interested in giving a 20 minute talk, get in touch with our Academic Team (Max, Alia, Samuel) or President (Keegan).*

*A quick note:*

The Talk "Getting started with DevOps for your Projects" has been postponed due to circumstances outside of our control. Hopefully we'll get to host it soon\!
