Hello hello, and welcome to the first UWCS newsletter of this academic year\!

### **Welcome to The Computing Society\!**

Hi\! We're UWCS, the computing society here at Warwick and we do things\! In "charge" is 7 of us, elected by all of you and we all have our own responsibilities. You can learn more about us over on our website (https://uwcs.co.uk/about/exec). For the next few weeks, each one of us will be writing a little segment to introduce ourselves, so why not start with me\!

\---

Hi there\! My name's Josh, I'm a second year Computer Science student and I'm the President of CompSoc\! This means I'm generally in charge of the day-to-day running of the society and get involved in way too many things around the place. Outside of society things, you will see me talking about Blahaj's (IKEA sharks for those uninitiated), probably attempting to play video games and failing, or just sleeping\! Any of those work... :D

### **Pub is back\!**

Pre-Covid, we would head over to the Phantom Coach (a pub in Canley) every week, grab a meal together and chat the night away. Now, pub is making it's official return\!

Fancy joining us this week? We'll be meeting outside DCS at **6.30pm** tonight, and then walk over for **7pm**. You're more than welcome to join a bit later or meet us there\!

### **Friday Night Gaming**

It's happening again\! Come join us in the ground floor of DCS - we'll put out our range of consoles and games for you to come and enjoy. We'll also hopefully have Steam working again so you can come and play your own games too\!

As this event is in-person, we'll be asking people to follow the following safety precautions:

  - All attendees will have their temperature checked and be asked to sign in on arrival for tracing purposes in the event of a positive case.
  - Social distancing and mask wearing will be strongly encouraged.
  - Please have the NHS-Covid19 app installed and active on your phone if possible.
  - We encourage you to take a lateral flow test before and after the event.
  - If you test positive, display ANY Covid-19 symptoms or at all feel unwell, please do not attend the event\!

If you have any questions about the event, or test positive for Covid-19 in the days following the event, please get in touch with a member of the exec, either through Discord DMs or via email at <exec@uwcs.co.uk>

### **Coming up in Term 1**

Let's take a quick look at what we have coming up for you this term:

  - LANs\! We have booked out LIB2 for the weekends of Week 4 and Week 7 so get them down in your diary. Come join us to hang out, eat pizza and play games all weekend\! More info for these will be announced closer to the time.
  - Our Lightning Talks will be making a return, with two sets this term\! Come learn from a range of people across the university and the society about a wide range of topic in TED-style talks.
  - Advent of Code has become a regular occurrence within the society and we plan to take part again this year\! Look out for more information closer to December about how to get involved.
  - We'll also be running occasional socials for women and non-binary members of the society throughout this term. We'll keep you all updated once we finalise plans\!
