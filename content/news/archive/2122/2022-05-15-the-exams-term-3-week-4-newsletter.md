## 🍻 Dirty Duck Meal

#### 🕕 *Monday 6pm* 📍 [Dirty Duck](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=2202)

## **🎮 Friday Night Gaming**

Join us until midnight in DCS for a stress-free night of fun\! We've got a wide range of consoles, from retro to modern, including classics such as Rock Band and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Not only that, but our very own Valve Index VR setup, with a wide selection of games (not just Beat Saber)\! It's also just a chill place to hang out, and have a little break from the revision grind.
