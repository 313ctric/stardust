<p>It&#x27;s the start of week 2 and we&#x27;ve got lots coming up for you, so let&#x27;s dive right into this week&#x27;s newsletter!</p>

<!-- more -->

Heyo\! It's Week 2, which means things are starting to ramp up again. Let's get straight into the news from us this week\!

### **Meet our Academic Coordinator\!**

Hey there - I'm Keegan, a third year Discrete Mathematics student who also happens to be the society's Academic Coordinator for this year. I'll usually be the one trying to organise the talks and events that stop us from transforming into a gaming society :p . Speaking of which, we have some talks coming up in under 24 hours\! They're all from incoming second years who wanted to get involved, and share some knowledge. If that sounds like something you'd be interested in doing later on in the year, just drop me a message.

We should hopefully be hosting a CTF (Capture the Flag) event later in the term, where you can break into some virtual machines. And last but not least, keep your eyes peeled for December 1st, when Advent of Code rolls around once again. That's all from me - hope to see you at the Lightning talks tomorrow\!

### **While you're reading this...**

Psst\! *We're looking for a Secretary to join* as an official member of the exec team for this academic year. Some of the responsibilities: helping to write the newsletter you're reading right now, organising and recording the minutes of meetings, helping to book rooms for in-person events, and also sorting out some merch orders\! Unfortunately due to SU regulations, you won't have voting privileges at meetings - but we don't have a rigid structure either, so you're more than welcome to help out with other aspects of the society.

If this does sound like something you're interested in, please send an email to <exec@uwcs.co.uk> and let us know a bit about yourself, why you'd be good for the role, and what you'd bring to the exec team.

The deadline is **23.59pm** on the **19th October**, and we'll aim to pick someone by the end of that week. We look forward to hearing from you\!

### **Lightning Talks**

#### *Wednesday 5pm-6.30pm, Teams & Discord*

As Keegan mentioned above, we've got our next installment of Lightning Talks coming up tomorrow afternoon\! We've got a lovely set of speakers lined up for you, speaking for about 15 minutes on a topic of their choosing. Here's a quick overview of all the talks:

**Why Vim? -** A short and sweet intro to the Vim text editor to help you decide if it's for you\! If you're a coder, writer, or general power-user, come along and see what the hype is all about.

**Embedded Programming in Rust -** An intro to the Rust language, the concept of embedded programming, and trying get an LED to blink.

**How do I React? -** Why is everyone and their Mum using React? This talk gives an introduction to the basic principles of React, and why you should use it for your next web UI.

You can join us on Teams (<https://go.uwcs.uk/lightningtalks-oct21>) or Discord (<https://discord.uwcs.uk>) for these talks. We hope to see you there\!

### **Friday Night Gaming**

It's happening again\! Come join us in the ground floor of DCS - we'll put out our range of consoles and games for you to come and enjoy. We'll also hopefully have Steam working again so you can come and play your own games too\!

As this event is in-person, we'll be asking people to follow the following safety precautions:

  - All attendees will have their temperature checked and be asked to sign in on arrival for tracing purposes in the event of a positive case.
  - Social distancing and mask wearing will be strongly encouraged.
  - Please have the NHS-Covid19 app installed and active on your phone if possible.
  - We encourage you to take a lateral flow test before and after the event.
  - If you test positive, display ANY Covid-19 symptoms or at all feel unwell, please do not attend the event\!

If you have any questions about the event, or test positive for Covid-19 in the days following the event, please get in touch with a member of the exec, either through Discord DMs or via email at <exec@uwcs.co.uk>
