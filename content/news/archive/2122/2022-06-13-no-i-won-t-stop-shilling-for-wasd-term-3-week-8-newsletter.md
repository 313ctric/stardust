## 🍻 Dirty Duck Pub Meal

Our regular Monday pub trip is heading to The Dirty Duck for this week's pub meal\! Meet us there at **6pm**\!

## 🧠 CS259 Revision Session

#### 🕗 *Tuesday 2pm* 📍 [MB0.08](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=17265&project_id=1)

We'll be running through content and questions from CS259 Formal Languages (let's see if we can pump some more knowledge into your brains). This session is a bit impromptu, but we'll cover some of the later weeks' topics, as well as any requested\! Finally, we'll discuss some general tips for the exam.

## 🍺 Coventry Pub Crawl with Minecraft, CodeSoc and WAI

#### 🕗 *Thursday 6:30pm*

In collaboration with a multitude of societies, we will be running a pub crawl in Coventry next Thursday as exams are coming to an end. <sup>Coincidentally, right after the Formal Languages exam.</sup> We will be meeting at **Terrace Bar** from **18:30**. After this, we will be taking the **19:55** 12X bus from Interchange to Pool Meadow and walk to the Flying Standard where people can choose to get food. Followed by stops at Tipsy, The Castle Grounds or Ivy House (depending on the atmosphere), The Phoenix and finally Quids Inn. For those not living in Coventry, the last bus back towards campus will be the **23:45** 11 from Pool Meadow bus station. This is relatively early, so if you are taking the bus, please keep this in mind. We recommend you do a lateral flow test at least 24 hours before the event. Feel free to bring along any friends. Hope to see you all there

Full plan for the evening:  
`  18:30 - ~19:50 Terrace Bar19:55 - 20:15 12X Bus to Pool Meadow20:15 - ~21:30 The Flying Standard21:30 - ~22:30 Tipsy22:30 - ~23:00 The Castle Grounds/Ivy House23:00 - ~23:30 The Phoenix23:30 - late Quids Inn Pub `

## **🎮 Friday Night Gaming**

#### 🕗 *Friday, 8pm-12am* 📍 [*Department of Computer Science*](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=1547)

Exams are almost over, but that doesn't mean the fun can't stop. Join us until midnight in DCS for a stress-free night of fun\! We've got a wide range of consoles, from retro to modern, including classics such as Rock Band and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Not only that, but our very own Valve Index VR setup, with a wide selection of games (not just Beat Saber)\! It's also just a chill place to hang out, and have a little break from the revision grind.

## 👕 Merch Update

We gave out loads of merch last Friday\! But there is still plenty more to go\! The cards *and mousepads* should be ready by this Friday Night Gaming, which means we will have everything\!

If you are at any other UWCS events in the next couple of weeks, DM me and I can bring it with me. If you won't be available to collect, DM me at `EricTheLemur#8899`, and we can start arranging deliveries once all the merch is here.

## 🏃‍♂️ WASD: Speedrunning for Charity

#### 🕗 *Saturday and Sunday* 📍 *Esports Centre and Twitch*

**WASD is happening this coming weekend\!** And no, that does not mean I can stop shilling yet. We have some great stuff, from the popular: *Mario Kart 8* and a *Celeste* Race; to the weird: *Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear To The Rescue* and *Celeste* using *Donkey Kong Bongos*.

In-person runs (11:30 to 18:30 Saturday and 8:20 to 16:00 Sunday) will be live in the **Esports Centre**. Come along and give the runners some support\! All runs will also be streamed to the **Warwick Esports** [**Twitch channel**](https://www.twitch.tv/warwickesports).

WASD is a charity event in support of SpecialEffect, so remember to give generously -- we do have some fun incentives planned\!
