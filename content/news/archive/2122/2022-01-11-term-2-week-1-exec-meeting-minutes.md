### **WEEK 2 LAN:**

  - Keegan is doing a quiz again - everyone is encouraged to submit rounds\!
  - MineSoc are happy to do something again.
  - GeoGuessr and FNG will be happening.
  - Good idea to take both switches and rockband based on previous demand.
  - Saturday afternoon slot is currently free. Previously has been Board Games and Questionable Steam Games in this slot.
  - We have all the equipment sorted for VR now.
  - Looking to make the announcement soon (Tuesday night or Wednesday morning).

### **WEEK 2 LIGHTNING TALKS:**

  - Option 1: Scramble something together.
  - Option 2: Postpone by a week or two.
  - Option 3: Cancel entirely and just have one set of talks this term (would be a shame).

### **FRIDAY NIGHT GAMING:**

  - Josh has still not heard back from Paul. Went to see him today but he was working from home. Will chase it up again tomorrow.
  - Better tripods for VR have arrived (so we can have a better setup now).
  - Would still be nice to invest in some more Wii remotes.

### **WASD:**

  - Still need to get in touch with Coach regarding the Esports centre.
  - Someone needs to take over as a contact point with Ingram regarding art. Ideally, someone who is also planning to run for an exec position next year.

### **KEY QUOTES:**

‘Keegan what are you doing\!?’ - Ella

‘You will be recorded *late*’ - John to Skiros, after turning up 30 minutes late

‘Can I go back to bed?’ - Skiros
