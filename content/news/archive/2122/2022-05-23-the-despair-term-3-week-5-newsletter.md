With 1st year exams about to start, 2nd year exams starting soon, and 3rd year exams on their way to being over: there's something for everyone to despair about\!

## **WASD: Speedrunning for Charity  
*Submission Last Week: Deadline Extended***

Submissions Closing 📅 *Saturday 28th May 11:59pm* 📍 [*warwickspeed.run/signup*](https://warwickspeed.run/signup)  
WASD 📅 *18th-20th June* 📍*In-person, on-campus\!*

*Only a week left to submit a recording of a run\! This doesn't have to be your best or anything, but we need an idea of what we would get\!  
* We are just looking for a decent run (with commentary if you like), so don't worry about the video quality (filming a screen is fine).

Our charity speedrunning event is back for 2022. It is the largest student-run speedrunning event and has raised over £6000 for SpecialEffect.

*No matter whether you've never done a speedrun before in your life, or you've managed to nab a few records yourself, wanna help us raise some money for a good cause?*
