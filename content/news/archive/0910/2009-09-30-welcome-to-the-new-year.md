We'd like to extend a warm welcome both to previous, and prospective new members, to the new academic year.  
Over the summer, we've been working to extend the range of services that we offer to our members. We now have a range of "gaming servers":http://www.steamcommunity.com/groups/uwcs operating from on campus, and also have plans laid for some great activities over the course of the next year. These include forthcoming trips to IBM, interesting talks from people in the technology industry and of course a number of our fantastic LAN parties.

If you want to keep abreast of what we're offering, it's strongly recommended you keep an eye on the "Events":/events section of this site, which also has a handy "RSS":/feeds/events/ feed.  
To become involved in the society, the best way is to pop into our "IRC chat room":/cms/about/services/irc and get to know us\!

Finally, if you've just joined the University this year, come and see us at the society's fair, where we'll be on both Wednesday and Thursday\! We'll have cookies, or... something.
