Hello CompSoc\!

First of all, a big welcome to all the new freshers\! I hope that  
you've had an action packed first week, without too many hangovers\!  
Hopefully you turned up to gaming yesterday, but if not then have no  
fear, as it runs every Friday.

There will be a freshers social this Monday, which you should come  
along to and meet the exec, after which those that are interested will  
be able to walk to the pub with us to have a bite to eat, chat to  
current members, and possibly have a pint.

We will be heading over to Alton Towers to celebrate Halloween, and  
there are still a few spaces left. We will be providing transport to  
and from campus via coach. Including the tickets to get in we have got  
a price estimate of £20-£30. Once we have confirmed the numbers we can  
confirm the pricing, so please sign up as soon as possible. Signups  
close Sunday 18th October. Considering Alton Towers is £37 for a  
ticket on the day, you will not be getting a better deal\! Head over to  
http://uwcs.co.uk/events/details/1093 for more information.
