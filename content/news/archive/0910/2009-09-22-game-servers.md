We're happy to say that today we opened a number of game servers for a number of source based games. These are:  
Counter-Strike: Source - 137.205.210.236:27015  
Team Fortress 2 - 137.205.210.236:27011  
Left 4 Dead - 137.205.210.236:27010

These are in addition to existing Warsow and DoTA servers which are also being hosted on campus. Furthermore, we have a Mumble (free voice communication software) server running at mumble.uwcs.co.uk:19000.

If you're interested in playing any games with us, but particularly Valve Source based games, please feel free to join our "Steam group":http://steamcommunity.com/groups/uwcs.
