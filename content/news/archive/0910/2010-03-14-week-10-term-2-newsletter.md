Hello CompSoc\!

We've got the usual stuff this week, the pub social in the Phantom Coach on Monday to Gaming on Friday.

A note to those who were at gaming last Friday:  
\-There is some lost property from gaming, a hat/gloves/scarf combo and some notebooks with mathematics notes in, get in touch with Agaeki if any of this is yours.  
\-Also, the room was left quite a mess after gaming, food trodden into the carpet etc. If you're going to have food at gaming, PLEASE ensure you take it with you or throw it away when you're finished.  
We don't want to ban our members from eating at gaming, but we'll have to if people continue to not clean up after themselves.

example WordPress).
