Greetings CompSoc\!

Unfortunately this week Mogmiester is marooned somewhere remote, so  
you're stuck with my ramblings instead of his.

If you're not aware, there is a LAN party coming up in a few weeks.  
Signups are already pretty full, so please checkout  
http://uwcs.co.uk/events/details/1130/ for more details ASAP.

Not much else to say really other than what we have this week, which  
is the same sort of fun as usual\! You might want to note that I am  
doing a Python Programming tutorial on Wednesday. Hopefully should be  
educational for everyone, including me\! :D
