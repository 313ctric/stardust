Hello Compsoc\!

After a lengthy discussion at Friday's exec meeting, we have decided  
that we will no longer be advertising food as part of the pre-gaming  
social. You can order food if you want, but please be aware that even  
if the dirty duck is full, we won't be moving over to Rootes Social  
building or the like. If you liked food at the social and think this was the  
wrong decision to make, or if you have any other ways you think that  
the society could be improved, you should come along to the exec  
meeting next Monday and have your say on how the society is run\!  
Note that there is no Exec meeting this week.

There are also a lot of Warwick Game Design events running this week,  
including a workshop followed by a console social on Wednesday. Please  
check the events page of our website for up to date information about  
what's going on this week.

There is also a talk on Wednesday about how to get the most from your  
shell account. Every member is entitled to a free shell account, which  
can be used for IRC, website hosting and lots of other interesting tricks.  
If you want to come along to the first academic talk of the year (which I  
really recommend you do) you should ask for a shell account at

Chatting with us  
\=========================================  
We also recommend you connect to our IRC network so you can chat to our  
members a bit and get to know them. It's the best way to get to know members  
of the society, and there are always people online to talk to.

Find out more at: http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/services/irc/

Web Hosting  
\=========================================  
If you're interested in hosting, you'll want to go to http://uwcs.co.uk/member/  
and fill in the request form for a shell account. You'll need to make a separate  
request for database account (a MySQL account) if any of your sites  
use that (for example WordPress).

Further Info  
\=========================================  
If you have any other questions, http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/faq/ is a  
good place to start, and you can always drop us a line at  
compsoc-exec@uwcs.co.uk.

I hope you have a good week, and look forward to seeing you at our  
socials\!

Matthew Alves/Mogmiester  
Secretary
