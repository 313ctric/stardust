Hey CompSoc,

For those of you still alive after the Real Ale festival, here's a  
newsletter for this week.

We have our regular pub social at the Phantom Coach on Monday and Gaming  
on Friday in DCS.  
We're also having our exec meeting on Friday this week before Gaming, so  
feel free to come along and watch us attempt to prevent the society  
spiralling into chaos.

This week's events  
\=========================================  
Pub Social on Mon, 8th March

Chatting with us

Web Hosting  
\=========================================  
If you're interested in hosting, you'll want to go to  
http://uwcs.co.uk/member/  
and fill in the request form for a shell account. You'll need to make a  
separate  
request for database account (a MySQL account) if any of your sites use  
that (for  
example WordPress).

Further Info  
\=========================================  
If you have any other questions, http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/faq/ is a  
good place to  
start, and you can always drop us a line at compsoc-exec@uwcs.co.uk.

Regards,

Sigma D (Robert Steele)
