Greetings CompSoc\!

Some important announcements this week, LAN sign-ups are open for both  
the week 5 LAN and the BFL. Make sure to sign-up early to avoid  
disappointment.(Maybe not so much for the week 5 Exam-LAN.)

The Week 5 LAN will also have the speed programming competition, more  
details on this soon.  
For those of you who want to buy more pizza than you can eat in one  
sitting, there is a 'beast pizza' order for the week 5 LAN as well.

We also have our usual Pub social at the Phantom Coach and Friday  
night/Saturday morning gaming this week.

Web Hosting  
\=========================================  
If you're interested in hosting, you'll want to go to  
http://uwcs.co.uk/member/  
and fill in the request form for a shell account. You'll need to make a  
separate  
request for database account (a MySQL account) if any of your sites use  
that (for  
example WordPress).

Further Info  
\=========================================  
If you have any other questions, http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/faq/ is a  
good place to  
start, and you can always drop us a line at compsoc-exec@uwcs.co.uk.
