Greetings CompSoc\!

Just a quick message about the BFL, our week long LAN in week 10, starting on Monday morning.

There is one place remaining, so if you haven't signed up already, be quick\!  
(If signups fill up, and you REALLY want to go, try e-mailing the exec, although I can't promise anything.)

For those of you already signed up, standard pre-LAN procedure is advised, updating games etc.  
The steam summer sale is on, so you might want to look at picking up some stuff from there.

IMPORTANT: Please note that, as in previous LANs, it is ONE monitor per person. Nobody likes the power cutting out mid-LAN, and if you've checked the seating pattern, you'll see space is also a factor.

Hope to see you all at the BFL, and if not, have a good summer.

Web Hosting  
\=========================================  
If you're interested in hosting, you'll want to go to http://uwcs.co.uk/member/  
and fill in the request form for a shell account. You'll need to make a separate  
request for database account (a MySQL account) if any of your sites use that (for  
example WordPress).

Further Info  
\=========================================  
If you have any other questions, http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/faq/ is a good place to  
start, and you can always drop us a line at compsoc-exec@uwcs.co.uk.

Regards,
