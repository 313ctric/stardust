Update 2004/03/01

### Update 2004/03/01

Hi all,

The LAN was had this weekend, and it was a roaring success, with all sorts of fun with hardware, foam “lightsaber” fights, and some excellent games of things like Generals, UT2k4, and Savage.

Two items of lost property were discovered in the process of clearing up the LAN:

1.  A mobile phone charger
2.  A set of keys

If you think that either of these belong to you, please contact me (phil@uwcs.co.uk) with a description of the items and we will arrange to have them returned to you as soon as possible.
