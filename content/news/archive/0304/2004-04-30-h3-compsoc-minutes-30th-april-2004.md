#### Minutes

##### LAN

Signups will open at midnight on Saturday for 20 people, possibly to be increased when Neil Williams (the campus electrician) gets back to us. Guest signups 24 hours later. ITS need contacting about network access. Also we need more tables if we’re having both rooms.

##### Gaming

This is now in B2.08. Si1entDave, as president, needs to sign an agreement with someone about the room.

##### DCS cupboard and VLAN

Phil needs to sort both of these.

##### Handover

A couple of courses have been missed, these need attending later if possible. Zephran still needs to book and attend the finance course.

##### “Tao” of CompSoc

Nothing has been done yet. Pete and Mish will work on this.  
h5.
