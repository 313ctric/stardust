Hi, folks, and welcome to CompSoc in 2004\!

This term, we have a whole bunch of events planned. Two LAN parties, guest lectures, tutorials, socials, a variety of trips, as well as the usual gaming and pub socials. Keep an eye on the newsletter for information about upcoming events.

Finally, a reminder: pings to or from campus are firewalled by the university, so do not be surprised if they do not work. Also, users in halls will only be able to access IRC on port 6668, not the usual 6667.
