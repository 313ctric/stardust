#### 2 Academic

##### 2.1 Steve Matthews Lecture

Dr. Steve Jarvis is unfortunately busy this term. Instead, we have rearranged a planned talk by Dr. Steve Matthews from next term to this term. The talk will be an hour’s introduction to “Philosophy for Programmers”, Steve Matthew’s research topic. This will be on Tueday of Week 10, at 5pm, in the L4 lecture theatre (beside L3).

##### 2.2 Bletchley Park Trip

We are organising a trip to Bletchley Park on the Saturday following Week 9. Bletchley Park is where Alan Turing worked, where British Computing started, and where the German ‘Enigma’ code was cracked in the Second World War. Prices will be around 18 per person. An sign-up is on the website now, at http://www.uwcs.co.uk/events/.

##### 2.3 Kevin Warwick Lecture

Kevin Warwick, the Professor of Cybernetics at Reading University, is coming to Warwick University to give an hour’s lecture on his cybernetic implants and the robotics research he is involved with. This event will happen on the second say of next term, that is Tuesday April 20th. Watch this space for more details\!

##### 2.4 Careers Presentations

The Careers Service has organised two interesting presentations in the coming week. Jagex is a game development company that runs a Role Playing Game called ‘Runescape’, at which a former president of the Computing Society is currently working. Lastminute.com is a fast-growing holiday booking website. Both are holding careers presentations next Tuesday:

  - Jagex presentation: 2nd March, MS.05, 1pm
  - Lastminute.com presentation: 2nd March, R.03/04, 6:30pm

#### 3 Socials

##### 3.1 LAN Party

That’s right, there’s less than a week to go until our next LAN party\! We are pleased to announce that we have increased the available spaces from 30 to 40. If you haven’t signed up yet, now’s the time to do so\!. Don’t forget, this LAN is in LIB2 (the upstairs room, just above Kaleidoscope). Turn up from 8pm, ensuring you have virus-scanned your machine before coming along. If you’re not sure how to virus scan your machine or are otherwise unable to, we will definitely be able to help you out. See you there\!

##### 3.2 Karting

A team of CompSoc members went Karting last Wednesday. Many congratulations to NeXuS7, who won the event by a clear margin in the final. Photos are here:

#### 4 Technical

##### 4.1 Technical Team

The CompSoc Technical Team has a current projects list at http://wiki.warwickcompsoc.co.uk/TechTeam/. Here, you can see all the jobs the Tech Team have in progress, or are planning for the future. If you wish to get involved in the Technical Team, this is a good place to start. Email us at techteam@warwickcompsoc.co.uk to find out more\!

##### 4.2 Insomnia Downtime

Many apologies for the recent downtime Insomnia has been suffering from. The first was due to upgrades to drastically improve its performance (Insomnia is now a Dual Athlon MP 2600+\!), the second was the result of a typo by a member of the Technical Team. Neither of these should happen again.

#### 5 MMORPG Announcement

The email sent out a few days ago was a request from some of our members for anyone wishing to get involved in the development of a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game. If you’re interested in helping, drop an email to nick@corematrix.co.uk.

#### 6 CAT6

We still sell CAT6 cable to our members. The price is a 50p base charge plus 50p per metre for the first 10 metres plus 40p for every metre thereafter. For example, 20m will cost you 0.50 + 5.00 + 4.00 = 9.50.
