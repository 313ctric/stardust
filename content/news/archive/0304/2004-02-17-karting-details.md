Please see http://www.uwcs.co.uk/\~nexus7/kartinglocation.JPG and let me know if you want a lift from Leamington to Karting. We need to be there for 3pm so don't be late (Sadiq\!). Robo and DrWatson have kindly offered lifts from campus, so please contact them if you require one. I would suggest that you would all need to meet at rootes reception about 2.15pm which then gives us plenty of time to get there for 3pm. I have paid &£10 deposits for everyone so make sure you have &£30 and some change for vending machines if you want a drink or snack. I look Forward to seeing you all tomorrow for some (almost need for speed) karting action\! NeXuS7
