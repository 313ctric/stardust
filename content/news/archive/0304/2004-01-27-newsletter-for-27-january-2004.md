### Member-wide mail on 27th Jan 2004

#### Guest lecture tomorrow, Linux help this weekend

You may remember last term the Linux User Group was going to host a free guest lecture by Dave Jones, a noted kernel hacker. Unfortunately we had to cancel, but we rescheduled it to tomorrow (Wed 28th Jan), 4pm, L4. Dave Jones has worked on several areas of the Linux kernel, which is not just an extremely widely used piece of software, but also a hugely complex global team development project. The lecture is free, and everyone is welcome.

Also, if you want to try Linux on your own machine (handy for CS120 when the labs are full, for example) but you donâ€™t know where to start, then you can bring your machine to B213 (on the science concourse) this weekend and the LUG will give you free help with any installation or configuration issues you might have.

For more information on these and other events, and more about the LUG, see http://www.uwlug.org.uk/
