It has come to our notice that a few people have been getting mail errors. This is due to the fact that a weasel stole our POP server. This will be shortly fixed, by virtue of Si1entDave and DrWatson comandeering a Land Rover Defender, and going off-road to steal it back again. As is right and proper, we will be following the lessons learnt from the A-Team, and customising the vehicle. This will include the addition of both CB and UHF radios, increasing of the ground clearance, and adding a large M16 minigun to the roof. We hope that normal service will be resumed shortly. (Any suggestions for further Landy customisations to techie@)
