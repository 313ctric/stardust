And lo LAN was had. And lo it was good\!  
Hope you all enjoyed yourselves. If you preferred that room then please register your opinion with the exec.

Thank you to all the exec and other members who helped set everything up and tidy away. Big thanks to DrWatson and Si1entDave for constant efforts fixing everyone?s problems and keeping the network up at the expense of their own gaming and/or sanity.

Next time everyone is to /actually/ run a full virus scan before coming to the LAN. Punishment for failing to do this will be decided on the day, but is likely to blunt object (frequently referred to as a mace) and a lot of blood.
