### Members-wide mail on 20th Jan 2004

#### Free guest lecture by Jason Clifford tomorrow

The Linux User Group is hosting a free guest lecture tomorrow (Wednesday 21st January) by Jason Clifford of ukfsn.org, an ISP which he runs using Linux and which donates all its profits to free software projects. This will offer a valuable insight into various aspects of the running of a technology-centric business which many LUG and CompSoc members may see as a future career path. If youâ€™ve ever wondered what goes on inside an ISP or how they manage to connect you to the rest of the world, this is your chance to find out.

The lecture is at 4pm in L4 and all are welcome. More information at http://www.uwlug.org.uk/
