ISE STUDENTS\! (And anyone else who’s interested.)

There is going to be a free tutorial on Swing, the popular Java windowing toolkit, given by a member of the Computing Society. It will include suggestions on how to get around the intricacies of Swing’s threading that you won’t necessarily find in the documentation. All are welcome, whether you are ISE students or not. You don’t even have to be a member of the society. The important info is:

  - Date: Tuesday 17th February
  - Time: 4pm
  - Place: Meeting Room 3 (Union North)
