Heya folks,

As many of you will have noticed, molotov was inaccessible between about 2am and 8am last night. This was due to the University's Internet connection going down, and was completely outside our control. More information is available on the ITS announcements page, or the uwarwick.its.announce newsgroup.

Additionally, many of you in halls are having trouble accessing our IRC server. Due to a DOS attack from inside the Warwick Piazza network, the University network has been forced to block all requests to the IRC port. We are in touch with the Piazza technical team over this issue, and they are looking into sorting it out. In the meantime, you can connect to the usual server (irc.warwickcompsoc.co.uk) on port 6668 (or, as always, 6669 for SSL).
