The mysteries of where we keep our gaming servers has finally been unveiled\! We now have a page up at /gaming/servers which lists all of our gaming servers, tells you wether they're up and how long they've been up, what map they're on and how many players are using them. If you click the "info" links, you can also see who's on them.
