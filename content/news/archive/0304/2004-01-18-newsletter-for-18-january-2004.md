### Members-wide mail on 18th Jan 2004

#### LAN Signups

Due to technical problems with molotov, LAN signups did not open as expected at 11pm on Saturday evening. To ensure the signups remain fair, member signups have been moved back to 12 midday, Sunday (today), 18/01/2004. Guest signups will remain at 11pm next Saturday.

Finally, if you were running any processes on molotov, you may wish to check if these processes are still active.

Apologies for the inconvenience - this problem should not reoccur.

Phil Stoneman  
President
