The LUG is hosting a free guest lecture this Wednesday (21st Jan) at 4pm, in L4, by Jason Clifford of ukfsn.org, an ISP which he runs using Linux. All profits of ukfsn.org are used to fund free software in the UK.

Translation: This guy does what many of you will want to do as a career, and he is coming here to talk about it.
