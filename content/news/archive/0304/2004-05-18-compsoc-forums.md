We now have our own forums at http://forums.warwickcompsoc.co.uk/ All are welcome to join, whether members or not, so feel free to go and use them, poke them, generally explore. Any glitches/requests should go to the tech team, and we'll get it sorted. They're very much experimental at the moment, we're still ironing things out, so go find the bugs for us\!
