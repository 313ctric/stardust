Server Update: The migration from MySQL3 to MySQL4 is now complete. All users, grants and database files have been transferred, MySQL4 is now running on the default port of 3306, and the MySQL3 server has not been restarted. If anyone has any questions, or finds that something has suddenly stopped working, mail techteam@warwickcompsoc.co.uk and we'll get it fixed.
