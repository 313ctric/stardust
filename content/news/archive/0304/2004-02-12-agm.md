The CompSoc AGM will be this Saturday (14th) at 8pm in MR4/5 (Union North - above Costcutter; the door is on the right of Costcutter) all members are encouraged to show up - we'll be voting on the new exec finding out how you thought the society has been going, as well as presenting accounts for the past year.

We look forward to seeing a large part of our membership there, and are hoping for candidates for the new exec to be from a more academic background this year - if you'd like to apply, just turn up\!
