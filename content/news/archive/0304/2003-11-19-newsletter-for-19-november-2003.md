#### PAINTBALL\!\!

Hi everybody, reminder that the deadline for signing up for paintball is tomorrow at 2pm.

Just to repeat a few points:

1.  You do NOT have to be a member of paintball society.
2.  Cost is &£30 for a full day’s paintball and 500 rounds of ammunition - this is much cheaper than you will find anywhere else.
3.  This is a great way to see what paintball is about and you get to shoot me.

Complete details (including what and how to pay) are at http://www.draconas.co.uk/paintball.htm

Sign up by pinning your cheques to the paintball notice board in union north or if you want to pay in cash the paintball exec will be there at the deadline and can write cheques for you.

Chris  
Compsoc and Paintball Treasurer.
