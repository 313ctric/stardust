If you have a website hosted here as http://www.warwickcompsoc.co.uk/\~foo, it is now accessible as http://foo.warwickcompsoc.co.uk/ and you should check that it works under this new URL, because within the next day or so, we plan to redirect all requests for the first kind of URL to the second. Note, anything that was already accessible under a URL without a \~ in it (i.e. anything with a virtual host) should be completely unaffected. If you would like any help with anything related to this or any other issue with our servers, feel free to drop into \#tech on IRC, or mail the technical team.
