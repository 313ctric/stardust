This week we have scheduled a talk by Dr. Steve Matthews. The talk will be an hour's introduction to "Philosophy for Programmers", Dr. Steve Matthew's research topic. This will be on Tueday of Week 10 at 5pm, in the L4 lecture theatre (beside L3).

This is an event that should not be missed\!

Update:

Lecture was had, and it was so popular that we outnumbered the people in the lecture next door\! Thanks to everyone who turned up for making it a success, and thanks especially to Dr Steve Matthews for giving the lecture.

Anyone who wishes to see the presentation slides can find them here.
