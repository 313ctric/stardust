CompSoc have two important social events coming up:

The first LAN party of term is at the end of next week. Signups are full, but don't let that discourage you - someone may well drop out, so it's worth signing up on the reserve list.

Also, on November the 15th, we are going to see The Matrix: Revolutions, only a week after it opens\! Signups are now open. Be sure to give your money to an exec member by November the 1st, otherwise we can't book your place.
