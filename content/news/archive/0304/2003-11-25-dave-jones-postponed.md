The Linux User Group had organised a free guest lecture by Dave Jones, a key developer of the Linux kernel, on Wednesday 26th November. Unfortunately it has had to be postponed due to forces beyond our (and his) control. It will be re-arranged for some future time, and announced on the LUG website.
