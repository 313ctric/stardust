#### 1\. Allnighter

Seeing as Baz is going, and Tom (Worley) is going, we will have enough hubs, and a BNC uplink. Henry (Southgate) is bringing a Linux box to use as a bridge, so we should be able to configure the network quite easily.

#### 2\. Switch

So far, unfortunately, no progress has been made on a switch. Baz to jump up and down upon Ryan to get him to hurry up.

#### 3\. Pub Social

The proposed Quiz to be held at the Pub Social will have as a prize a roll of bubblewrap. Jake to obtain bubblewrap.

#### 4\. Gaming

Friday gaming can continue despite the allnighter, since exec members can turn up and supervise. Richard Colfer has offered to conduct Saturdayâ€™s gaming if anybody does turn up.

#### 5\. Java Tutorial

Chris to actually get on and really actually /write/ something instead of pontificating on how wonderful it will all be.

#### 6\. Courses

We may need to do some more Onion courses. Suggestions so far are:

  - First Aid - Ryan?
  - Duty of Care - ?
  - How to Use Your Onion - Jake

#### 7\. Antichris

Denies all knowledge. 4 for, 1 abst. 5 present. Upon recount, 5 for, 1 abst. 5 present.

#### 8\. Next Meeting

1.  am on Friday morning next week, in the Bitchtank.
