#### 1\. Gaming/LANs

Gaming and the last LAN party have been going well - but we could do with more organisation at LANs, specifically with getting the network set up. A Hub was suggested, or a Switch - Baz to investigate the possibilities. We would need at least 8 sockets - probably no more would be needed since member’s hubs could be daisychained. Henry Southgate also mentioned at the last LAN that he may be able to bring a Linux box to act as a bridge. Talk to Henry nearer time of next LAN.

#### 2\. Chris’ House

It was minuted that Chris Salmon lived in a village where they were actually not allowed to place television aerials on the roof of their house. All laughed.

#### 3\. Money

Ryan claims that the financial situation is OK.  
Books for membership need to be in by Friday (27th).  
Chris Salmon was given £1 by Ryan to put in the pot.

#### 4\. OpenSource Project

Going well.  
Sourceforge account opened by Chris Salmon - Chris to continue and set up all areas of the account that we need. Majordomo list was asked after, but there was no reply.  
Likewise the possibilities of a Newsgroup or CVS account were investigated, but to no avail. The last two things are not so important with the SF account, however.

#### 5\. Bowling

Put forward until next week.

#### 6\. Java Classes

Concentrate on GUI. Chris Salmon to talk to Jarvis and ask about a room.

#### 7\. CS Tourney

James M to mail Jake when he has info ready, Jake to forward to members.

#### 8\. Pub Social

Arranged for tuesday of next week (31st of October), meeting up at 7pm in Rootes Reception. Going to Varsity from 7:10 onwards.

#### 9\. Karting

Baz still looking into Karting - probably. For all we know he’s simply sitting in his room eating Chris’ KitKats.

#### 10\. Next Meeting

1.  pm next thursday in the Bunker. Location to be decided from there.
