You might have noticed we've had a bit of down time recently - sorry about that\! We're in the process of a complete overhaul of our hosting infrastructure, with a planned completion date of November the 27th. Unfortunately there will have to be a little bit more downtime, but we'll do all we can to keep it to a minimum. Planned outages are as follows:

Tuesday 17th November: approx 1 hour, sometime between 1100 and 1700 UTC  
(MySQL only)

Friday 27th November: approx 2 hours, sometime between 1100 and 1700 UTC  
(MySQL and hosting)

After the 27th of November, all requests to uwcs.co.uk and irc.uwcs.co.uk will be routed through the new infrastructure. Any files you currently have will be kept in sync with the new servers, and the old server will remain on for two weeks after after this date to allow you to transition over.

Q: I have a website with you, what do I need to do?  
A: Unless you're storing files somewhere other than /home, everything will continue operating as normal :)

Q: What about my persistent IRC session?  
A: All running programs (like IRSSI) will have to be moved before the end of term - sorry, but there's no way around this :(

Q: How does this affect my specific setup?  
A: Feel free to email me at academic-president@uwcs.co.uk and I'll be happy to help

Once again, thanks for bearing with us\! It'll be worth it for the shiny new systems we're installing...
