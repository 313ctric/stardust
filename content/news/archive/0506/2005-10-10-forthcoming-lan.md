The Computing Society will be hosting the first LAN of this term at the end of Week 4, from Friday evening (21st Oct) until Sunday evening (23rd Oct). Signups open at 9pm this Wednesday; set a reminder in your phone now\!

We will have a UT2004 1v1 Tournament running on the Saturday; everyone will get a chance to play at least two games, so even if you're no good, it's still worth joining in. In addition, there will be an all-weekend long console gaming session operating in Lib 1; signups for Pro Evolution Soccer 4 and Tekken 5 tournaments will open at the same time as the main LAN signups.
