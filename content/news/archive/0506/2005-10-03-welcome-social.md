Hello and welcome to Compsoc\!

For everyone who's joined the society (and even those who haven't yet) there's a welcome social on Wednesday at 7.30 in Meeting Room 3, Union North.

The social should give you an opportunity to get to meet all the regular members and to know some of the cool things we've got planned in the upcoming year.

If you've got any questions, drop the exec an email or hop into IRC (irc.uwcs.co.uk, \#compsoc).
