Hello all, and welcome to the new academic year. The Computing Society has a wide variety of things planned this year, including our regular LANs, social trips, and academic events.

Signups for the Alton Towers Trip are open for the rest of this week.

Watch this space, and your email inbox, for details of forthcoming events\!

Note: If you have joined the Computing Society via the Student Union's website, please be patient. Your password for the CompSoc website will be emailled to you in the evening. If you have any problems logging in after that, please contact The Exec.
