We're off to see Hursley, one of IBM's biggest software development laboratories on the 16th of November (Wednesday)\!

We've got a coach booked to leave from campus at 12.00pm and depart from Hursley at 5.30pm (trip time is around two hours). The trip costs Â£4 to cover the coach hire.

IBM tell us they've arranged a good spread of speakers and demos, so it should be a great trip\!

You don't need to be a member to come along, non-members should email their names and university numbers to exec@uwcs.co.uk.
