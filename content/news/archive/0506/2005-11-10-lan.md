At the end of week 8, The Computing Society will be hosting the second LAN of this academic year, in Lib2. Further details are here. If you've missed the signups, please still sign up as a reserve - it's likely we'll be able to extend the signups once again, and if we do, the people signed up as reserves will be given priority.

Finally, if you realise closer to the time that you can't turn up, please cancel your signup to give someone else a chance.

See you all there\!
