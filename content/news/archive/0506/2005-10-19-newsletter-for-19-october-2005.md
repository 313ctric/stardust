The Video Game Design Society has organised a Guest Lecture featuring Philip Oliver from Blitz Games this Thursday 20th at 6:30pm in LIB2. Blitz are one of Europe’s top game developers responsible for the fantastic “Dizzy” series of games. Everyone is welcome, not just Compsoc / Video Game Design Soc members, entry is free, bring along anyone you think might be interested\!

Bit more information on the VGDSoc Blog: http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/vgdsoc/entry/concept\_to\_console/

#### 48hour Game Coding Event

The game coding event (GCE) is a 48-hour competition designed to challenge people’s coding and creativity skills. Entrants are given 48 hours to work, individually or in groups of up to three, on creating a game to match the event’s theme. The chosen theme for the event will be decided by blind vote the previous week and announced at the start of the competition.

People of all abilities are welcome and there’s plenty of scope for creating artwork and assets for your team if programming isn’t your thing.

The event will take part in B213/214 on the weekend of Week 6.

More Info here : http://lucidion.uwcs.co.uk/gce/rules.html

#### Console Tournament

Alongside the LAN Party in LIB2 will be a console tournament downstairs in LIB1. There will be tournaments in Pro Evolution Soccer 4 and Tekken 5, while casual play will include Halo 2, Need For Speed, Street Fight 3 among others.There will be signups for the console tournament on http://www.uwcs.co.uk , while signups for individual tournaments will take place at the event itself.

Friday evening will be a Free For All event with the tournaments not taking place until Saturday afternoon between midday and the late evening. More casual, non-tournament play will happen on Sunday all day until 7pm.

Signups are open now, so head over to http://www.uwcs.co.uk

#### Gaming Sessions / LAN Signups

Two weeks of very busy Gaming Sessions have gone by now filling all available space. Unfortunately (or fortunately?) Gaming is cancelled this Friday/Saturday as it is the first Compsoc LAN of the year\! As predicted all 34 spaces were filled VERY quickly indeed, a record 7 (seven\!) minutes was all it took for them to disappear. Luckily we did manage to grab some extra power thanks to the powers that be, and signups increased to 50. Alas, they also got filled up very quickly, and there is only reserve spaces left in case people drop out between now and Friday evening.

#### Socials

A mid-LAN social at Varsity will be happening this Saturday for anyone that wants to come along. It’ll be open to both those people at the LAN, and people that aren’t, expect an email in a day or two with more details.

Compsoc’s weekly trip to The City Arms (Monday) will be on again next week, but the pre-gaming social is cancelled due to no gaming :).

#### Exec Meeting

No exec meeting this week due to the LAN however Exec Meetings will resume next week…

Compsoc’s weekly exec meetings are at 7pm in a Meeting Room along the Union North corridor, so if anyone has anything they wish to bring up, or simply want to come and listen about what we have planned/are discussing do come along. If you do wish to bring anything specific up, please send a quick email to exec@uwcs.co.uk outlining what you want to say/discuss.

The meeting tends to last somewhere between an hour and 90 minutes depending on how much there is to talk about, and we head straight over to the 8:30pm pre-gaming social when we’re done.

#### LUG

Linux User Group meeting IS on this week (no, not another event cancelled because of the LAN), so head along to Union North to Xanana’s Lounge between 7 and 10pm. As always if you have any trouble using/installing/fixing Linux on your machine there are plenty of people willing to help.

#### IRC

  - Another\* mention for Compsoc’s IRC server again,

<!-- end list -->

  - server: irc.uwcs.co.uk - (if the default port doesn’t work from campus, try 6668 instead)
  - channel: \#compsoc

#### Cable / Web Hosting

Straight from the first and second newsletter (yes i’m lazy):

Compsoc provides many services to it’s members including the sale of Ethernet RJ45 cable, and a shell account and webspace on a Compsoc server.

Base charge for a cable is 40p plus 20p per metre. So,

For 5metres: 0.40 + (5 .20) = &£1.40  
For 10metres: 0.40 + (10 \* .20) = &£2.40  
For 20metres: 0.40 + (20 \* .20) = &£4.40

Very reasonably priced, and a lot cheaper than a certain amphibian sounding shop near costcutters.

The shell account on our server Molotov is free, and comes with 20MB of storage and is accessible from the url: http://.uwcs.co.uk . Extra quota is only &£2.50 for an extra 500MB, far cheaper than any hosting provider you’re likely to find. The server is on campus so uploading to it from the residential network/campus machines will be at LAN speeds. More information about our Web Hosting here:

C’est tout\!
