#### IBM Hursley Park Industrial Trip

Compsoc has organised a trip to IBM Hursley Park, one of IBM’s biggest software development labs, for Wednesday 16th November (Week 8). IBM have arranged a wide spread of speakers and fascinating demonstrations (especially if last year is anything to go by\!) so anyone going will be sure to see/hear some interesting material.

A coach is booked to take a maximum of 49 people, leaving at midday and returning from Hursley at 5:30pm. To help cover the cost of the coach the trip costs &£4 per person, but do only sign up if you are definitely coming as limited spaces means it’d be unfair on others, and Compsoc if there are empty (unpaying) seats.

To signup head over to: http://www.uwcs.co.uk/events/details/?id=497

#### Console Tournament Report

The first LAN of the year was also accompanied by an ongoing series of console tournaments, Vince (rakurai) has written a report detailing what happened:

Ok, the console session happened. The result?

Not a great turnout, Tekken 5 only brought in about 2 people. Tho we ended up running Tekken 5 at about 9pm, we had to drag in about 5 other players from the LAN party to make up the numbers.

Despite a number of hiccups however, the mood was positive nearing the end of group stages, and tournament drama broke out during the Double KO stages with some really intense matches :-) Bob took no shit in the decisive finals and went for the overkill… with a triple perfect using Paul\! :-O

Pro Evolution Soccer 4 ran on Sunday. This had a great final, great tournament, couldn’t have been better. Congratulations to Khoi for winning the tournament, using Juventus instead of that broken team Brazil :)

Bucko’s DDR session rocked all weekend. Eyetoy was practically the cream on the cake of the entire console session. I’ve never seen so much silliness people were willing to do in front of a camera :D

Overall? Great first console session. Although extremely tiring for myself with all the stress of tournament schedules etc., but I’m glad everyone had fun.

The date and venue for the next console tournament hasn’t yet been finalised, so keep an ear out :).

Until next time.

#### Gaming Sessions

Yup, on again this Friday and Saturday from 10pm - 4am in the ITS Rooms along the physics concourse (just after the two sets of automatic doors over the library bridge). Remember to bring headphones, and if a game you want to be played isn’t being played (and it is available to install) just come along and suggest it\!

#### Socials

Pre-gaming social on Friday starts at 8:30pm in Rootes Reception/The Bar until 10pm when we all head over to gaming for the evening/morning :). If you’ve not been along before, we normally sit down on the chairs in Rootes Reception as a group, just come and introduce yourself, grab some food/drink, even if you don’t want to go gaming.

#### LUG

Linux User Group meeting as always is on Wednesdays, so head along to Union North to Xanana’s Lounge between 7 and 10pm. As always if you have any trouble using/installing/fixing Linux on your machine there are plenty of people willing to help.

#### IRC

Yet **another** mention for Compsoc’s IRC server again,

  - server: irc.uwcs.co.uk - (if the default port doesn’t work from campus, try 6668 instead)
  - channel: \#compsoc

XChat: http://www.silverex.org/download/

#### Cable / Web Hosting

Straight from the first, second AND third newsletter (still lazy):

Compsoc provides many services to it’s members including the sale of Ethernet RJ45 cable, and a shell account and webspace on a Compsoc server.

Base charge for a cable is 40p plus 20p per metre. So,

For 5metres: 0.40 + (5 .20) = &£1.40  
For 10metres: 0.40 + (10 \* .20) = &£2.40  
For 20metres: 0.40 + (20 \* .20) = &£4.40

Very reasonably priced, and a lot cheaper than a certain **reptilian** sounding shop near costcutters.

The shell account on our server Molotov is free, and comes with 20MB of storage and is accessible from the url: http://.uwcs.co.uk . Extra quota is only &£2.50 for an extra 500MB, far cheaper than any hosting provider you’re likely to find. The server is on campus so uploading to it from the residential network/campus machines will be at LAN speeds. More information about our Web Hosting here:
