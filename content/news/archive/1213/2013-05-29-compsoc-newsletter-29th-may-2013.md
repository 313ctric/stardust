Greetings CompSoc\!

In-between owning exams you may be interested in coming to one of the events we have over the next two weeks, including gaming with a Dawn of War tournament, going to Crash with compsoc, football with compsoc, or the Internet Problem Solving Contest. Also, just announced:

SIGN-UPS FOR BFL ARE NOW OPEN  
To the uninitiated, the BFL (Big Fu... \*ahem\* Friendly LAN party), is the almighty 5-day annual end-of-year LAN event that gives you your money's worth for your (increasingly expensive) degree. Currently we have a 'pentathlon tournament' scheduled, and remember it's 98 hours of unbridled gaming entertainment with good company (with some returning home and sleeping at points if you're planning on living to the summer).  
Also, for the wannabe hackers among us, there will be a hackathon during the LAN for people to collaborate on some awesome project or other.  
BFL is Monday - Friday Week 10 this term.  
Sign-up here: http://uwcs.co.uk/events/details/1560/

Web Hosting  
\=========================================  
If you're interested in hosting, you'll want to go to http://uwcs.co.uk/member/  
and fill in the request form for a shell account. You'll need to make a separate  
request for database account (a MySQL account) if any of your sites use that (for  
example WordPress).

start, and you can always drop us a line at compsoc-exec@uwcs.co.uk.
