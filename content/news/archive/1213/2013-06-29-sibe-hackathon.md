The hackathon we ran in collaboration with SIBE last weekend was a success, with some students staying up the entire night to create their solution\!

The competition was won by a team from Sheffield University, who created a web platform for campaign organisations using Twitter Bootstrap, winning £250. CompSoc came second place, with a competing web platform winning £200. Third place was Adam Roberts, an independent developer from Liverpool who created an iOS app.

An article about the hackathon was published in The Boar and can be found [here](http://theboar.org/2013/06/27/sibe-hackathon-hosted-by-warwick/#.Uc6y2_lpNjY).
