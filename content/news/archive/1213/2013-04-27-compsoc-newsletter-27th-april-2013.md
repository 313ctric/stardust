Greetings CompSoc\!

This term we're planning for tournaments every gaming session, revision football, at least 2 programming competitions, post-exam BBQ, and two LANs (including the BFL, a LAN in Week 10 over 5 days).

\*WRONG\*: In the coming week we're having the Exam LAN. Come along and waste precious revision hours with all the usual great people, and maybe join in with the StarCraft 2 or Counter-Strike: Source tournaments. http://uwcs.co.uk/events/details/1535/

\*CORRECTION: Exam LAN will be held Week 3 rather than Week 2 this term due to a room booking problem.\*

If anyone would be interested in going with CompSoc to Eurogamer this summer, they should contact Murtag. gaming-president@warwickcompsoc.co.uk

If anyone is interested in going to iSeries with CompSoc this summer, they can join \#i49 on IRC. (See 'chatting with us' below.)

Chatting with us

We also recommend you connect to our IRC network so you can chat to our  
members a bit and get to know them. :D

Web hosting  
\=========================================  
If you're interested in hosting, you'll want to go to http://uwcs.co.uk/member/  
and fill in the request form for a shell account. You'll need to make a separate  
request for database account (a MySQL account) if any of your sites use that (for  
example WordPress).

Further info  
\=========================================  
If you have any other questions, http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/faq/ is a good place to  
start, and you can always drop us a line at compsoc-exec@uwcs.co.uk.

Regards,

Veltas (Christopher Leonard)
