On Thursday 22nd CoreFiling Ltd will be coming in to give a talk about continuous integration. The talk will take place in S0.13 at 5pm.

Abstract:  
“A talk about how continuous integration is a key tool for the rapid development of high-quality, reliable software. Topics will include an introduction to the ideas of continuous integration, an overview of some of the systems which implement it, how CoreFiling built their own system in the absence of a suitable alternative, challenges and limitations of CI, and an exploration of some of the emerging ideas which build on it, such as continuous deployment. The talk will last approximately 45 minutes and there will be an opportunity to ask questions.”

Hope to see you there\!

Ruth King,  
Academic President
