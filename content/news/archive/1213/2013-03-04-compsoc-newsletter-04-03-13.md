Web Hosting  
\=========================================  
If you're interested in hosting, you'll want to go to http://uwcs.co.uk/member/  
and fill in the request form for a shell account. You'll need to make a separate  
request for database account (a MySQL account) if any of your sites use that (for  
example WordPress).

If you have any other questions, http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/faq/ is a good place to  
start, and you can always drop us a line at compsoc-exec@uwcs.co.uk.
