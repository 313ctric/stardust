Remember guys and gals, Exec meetings are open to all members. If you've got something you want to say, or you think you can make a contribution, feel free to come along to Union North on Friday at 7pm, and join in. Probably a good idea to tell us in \#compsoc beforehand though, in case lack of a room means we have to move it somewhere else. Also, this week is the AGM.
