Due to a DOS attack being carried out on the campus network, services for the entire campus network are nearly all disabled, with the exception of web access. Further information can be found at the general "Campus Life" news page and at the ITS News page.

UPDATE: SSH and mail access to campus have been restored, so you can reach our normal IRC service using ssh.
