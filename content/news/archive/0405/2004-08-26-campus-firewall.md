As part of their new security measures, ITS are blocking a large amount of services. Until we are able to get things unblocked (sometime next week, we hope), you can access irc by connecting to irc.warwickcompsoc.co.uk, port 3389 (SSL IRC is at bermuda.warwickcompsoc.co.uk:3389).

You can log into molotov by SSH, anything else (e.g. email) will require a solution like SSH forwarding. If you're not sure how to do that, ask us on IRC, and we'll be happy to help.
