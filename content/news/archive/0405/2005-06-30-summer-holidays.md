The exams are over, results are out, the BFL and the end-of-year BBQ all went very well, and now it's time to chill out and relax over summer.

Next year, the exec have all sorts of exciting things planned, including Guest Lectures, tutorials, external trips, LANs, game tournaments, bowling trips, and much more. Watch this space next term for more information.

In the meantime, we hope everyone enjoys their summer and has a chance to relax after the academic year. Some people will be hanging out on IRC over the holiday, but, if you're not there, see you in October\!
