The signups for the CompSoc trip to IBM Hursley are now open. For those of you who don't know, Hursley is the main IBM Research and Development lab for the UK. The trip consists of a tour round the labs and a talk by some of the researchers who work there. This should prove to be interesting to anyone planning on a career in any sort of technical development field and will provide an insight in to how one of the world's major practical research labs works.

Update: Signups for this event are now closed.
