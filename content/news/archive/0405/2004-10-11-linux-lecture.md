Take the IBM Linux Challenge.

IBM has set a new Challenge for University students to make improvements to Linux, create usability tools or enhancements, or design Linux applications. Prizes will be awarded to the top 20 students who will receive an IBM ThinkPad (R) with Linux and will also have the opportunity to qualify for one of three summer 2005 Internships at our Linux Technology Center.

IBM are organising a lecture to explain the competition in L5 this Wednesday (13th) at 2pm. This will be an ideal talk for anyone who is thinking of working for IBM or indeed is just interested in Linux. Even if you don't plan to enter the competition it will provide insight into Linux in industry and promises to be interesting to all.
