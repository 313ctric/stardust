If you can't log in to mysql.uwcs.co.uk (or mysql.warwickcompsoc.co.uk) because it keeps bouncing you back to the login page with no error message, please delete the cookies for that hostname and try again. This is caused by a bug in the previous version of the upstream software, which is now fixed. Sorry for any inconvenience.
