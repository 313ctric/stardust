There will be an academic meeting on Wed at 5pm in union north. We haven't got a meeting room, so we're hoping to hax the lounge, if we're not in there, we'll more than likely have the meeting in rootes reception as its normally pretty quiet in there. The meeting will basically be me going "I'm the new academic officer, what do you want me to do" kind of meeting. Anybody is welcome to come along, we would love some fresh ideas :)
