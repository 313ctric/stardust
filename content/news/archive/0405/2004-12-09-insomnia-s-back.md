Insomnia has been fixed. We managed to get ITS to let us in (Ta Mark Charlton) and now things are back. There was a glitch with the module for the network interface (specifically it managed to escape being built. Oops.) We built the module with the new compiler, loaded it, all was well. Any mail that has been stacking up on servers should now be getting to its destination. For further info feel free to email the Tech Team at TechTeam@uwcs.co.uk or pop into the IRC server and get hold of me, (Si1entDave) or cmb.
