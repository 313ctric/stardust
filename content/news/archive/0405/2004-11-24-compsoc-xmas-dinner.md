This year the Compsoc Xmas Dinner will be in the Virgin and Castle in Kenilworth ("oooh suits you" I hear some of you say) at 7.30pm on Wednesday the 1st of December. It is a 3 course set menu, so signup now http://www.uwcs.co.uk/events/details/?id=361 and I look forward to seeing you all there. NeXuS7.
