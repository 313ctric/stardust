We need to bring down our IRC and SQL servers briefly this Saturday (18th September) at 9pm. This will affect IRC (irrespective of which method you use to access it), the main CompSoc website, and any members' websites that use SQL. Normal service should be resumed 5-10 minutes afterwards. For any queries, please contact the tech team.
