### Update - 2004/08/07

Hi folks,

Hope you’re all enjoying your holiday. As part of the Technical Team’s efforts to maintain a reliable service, we have slightly modified the DNS configuration of the Computing Society’s servers. These changes should be transparent, but if you notice any peculiar behaviour with Computing Society domain names, or any domains you may have hosted with CompSoc, please contact us (techteam@warwickcompsoc.co.uk), and we’ll sort them out.

For those of you that are interested, we have just implemented a secondary nameserver, configured to automatically synchronise with the primary server, meaning that all the domains we host can be resolved by either one of our two nameservers.
