Both of the servers currently known as Molotov will be unavailable this weekend, for major service migrations. This will affect all shell logins, websites, and email provided by the society. IRC should still be available. We aim to start closing services early on Saturday morning. An hour's warning will be given to users logged in and attempting to log in during this time. We aim to have the most important services back up and running on Saturday evening, but nothing should be relied upon before Sunday evening.
