A warm welcome to everyone who's just joined us. We look forward to seeing you at our events throughout the term, more about those above.

You can find our IRC server at irc.warwickcompsoc.co.uk port 6668 (6669 for SSL), but if you're off-campus, you'll need to use some alternative ports for the moment. This is due to a network security scare during the holidays which caused IT Services to alter their firewall policy. You can connect to irc.warwickcompsoc.co.uk port 3389, or if you would like to use SSL, bermuda.warwickcompsoc.co.uk port 3389.
