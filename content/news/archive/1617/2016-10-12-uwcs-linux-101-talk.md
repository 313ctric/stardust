<p>The slides and cheat sheet for the UWCS Linux 101 talk.</p>

<!-- more -->

Thanks to everybody that came along to the Linux 101 talk today\! We have made the presentation slides and the cheat sheet available to those that missed the talk or simply wanted to print them out. They can be found below.

Hopefully you learned something useful, if not how to use Linux and the shell at a basic level. Our next talk will be on the 26th October, the details of which are <span id="2335">available here</span>.
