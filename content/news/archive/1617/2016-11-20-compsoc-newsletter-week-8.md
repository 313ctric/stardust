\#\#\#\#Greetings Compsoc\!

  

Exciting news\! We now have another sponsor\! Give A Grad A Go will be sponsoring us for the academic year. They are a recruitment firm that specialises in graduate recruitment, who can help you guys get jobs, improve your CV or just learn about what skills are desired in an intern/graduate. For more information, see our \[sponsors page\](https://uwcs.co.uk/about/sponsors/) or read the blurb at the bottom of this email\! 

  

Also this week is Monday pub, where we all go to the Phantom Coach at 6:30pm (leaving from computer science at 6pm) and have a meal and a chat. We always welcome new people so don't be afraid to come say hi, even if you haven't been to any other events\!

Finally, we have an amazing internship opportunity from Deutsche Bank that I want to share with you all\!

  

\----

The Deutsche Bank Internship Programme is the ideal introduction to a career with us. It’s a job with real responsibility. It’s a way of realising your potential. It’s your chance to shine. Whether your interests lie in management, analysis or development, you will have everything you need to succeed in an international environment. It could also serve as your introduction to a thriving and lasting career. Our internships are a rich source of talent for the Deutsche Bank Graduate Training Programme, putting candidates who have completed the internship at an advantage of being accepted onto the Graduate Programme.

Although we have many roles requiring programming skills, you don’t need to be a technical expert to join Technology at Deutsche Bank. We’re looking for Developers, Project Managers and Business Analysts, so if you can use creativity and intellectual curiosity to solve difficult problems, you’ll find lots of opportunities to transform our business.

  

  

Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis and close on 31 December 2016.

You can shape the future of one of the world’s leading banks. Discover a career to look forward to at \[db.com/careers/technology\](db.com/careers/technology)
