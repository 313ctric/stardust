\#\#\#\#Greetings Compsoc\!

  

We have many things happening this week\!

  

\*\*NO GAMING OR PROGRAMMING THIS FRIDAY, LAN INSTEAD\*\*

  

The BBC are coming in at 2pm on Wednesday 26th October in CS1.04 (TOMORROW\!) to give us a talk on technology (probably about how they handle cloud computing in the context of iPlayer, but it could be different\!). It would be awesome to see you guys there\! The Facebook event is \[here\](https://www.facebook.com/events/1765260540395141/) and the website counterpart is \[here\](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/bbc-technology-talk/). 

  

We also have a careers workshop run by Work Ready Graduates, from 3:30pm until 5pm on Thursday 27th October. This is super useful for all year groups (even first year's can get internships you know\!) and will be focused on standing out at assessment centers and how to do well in interviews. The website event is \[here\](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/careers-workshop-assessment-centre-advice/).

  

Next, LAN IS THIS FRIDAY\! The LAN will from 8pm on Friday 28th October until 8pm on Sunday 30th October. We have an \[FAQ\](https://uwcs.co.uk/about/lan-information/) if you have no idea what's going on, and signups can be found \[here\](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/freshers-lan/). We usually have a seating plan that you can place yourself on, but for now we'll be using a google spreadsheet, the link to which will eventually be found on the event page\!

  

YOU MUST BE A MEMBER OF COMPSOC TO ATTEND OUR LAN EVENT (by paying via the SU website)\! AND YOU MUST SIGNUP ON OUR WEBSITE.
