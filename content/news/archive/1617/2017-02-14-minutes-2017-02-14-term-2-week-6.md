<p>Minutes week 6 term 2<br/></p>

<!-- more -->

Present: sam, dixon, david, kirby

\* Deadlines for manifestos? Intent to run? Need to advertise the AGM a bit
more. Separate email would be good.

\* Servers are almost nearly done. David received the last disk for Lovelace
yesterday so that's finally done. Just need to configure Milner to user LDAP
for sudoers and LDAP for user scripts, then we can open up to societies etc.
Currently LDAP does not have user accounts.

\* All websites will be hosted on Hopper from now on. Will have to set up Apache,
Node, PHP etc.

\* New switch for LAN has been bought and it has been marked. Still needs money
claimed back.

\* AGM is Wednesday Week 8 at 5pm.

\* Nominate Roger for Unsung Hero award.

\* Gaming ran fine without dcs-get.

\* Need to chase up money.
