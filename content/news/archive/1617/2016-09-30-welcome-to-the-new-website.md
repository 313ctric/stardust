<p>The new website was a long time coming, but it's finally here! A massive thank you to David Richardson, our tech officer, for basically doing all the work himself! Click "read more" for more info...</p>

<!-- more -->

Creating a more up-to-date website was a project that needed to be done, but was always overlooked, until now\! This shiny new website includes all of the features of the old one, as well as new stuff like automatically creating accounts on our server for web hosting when you press a button. We've even kept all of our old blog posts, newsletters and meeting minutes for everyone to read, all the way back to 1999\!

In case anyone is interested in any of the technical stuff, this website is powered by Django, but David wrote most of the templates for pages and objects on his own, so speak to or email him at <tech@uwcs.co.uk> for more info.

It's been an uphill battle to get this ready before the start of term, but we did it. If you're new to the society, you will automatically receive an email with your login details once you sign up to the society via the SU website. The email should hopefully come through within an hour\!

Finally, if you want to have a look at our old site (for legacy reasons), it's still available at [old.uwcs.co.uk](http://old.uwcs.co.uk).

Love Rhiba (President)
