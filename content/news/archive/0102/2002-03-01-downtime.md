Molotov is going down from 10pm Sunday, 3rd March, for routine maintenance. We expect Molotov to be up and running again well before 11pm, but this depends on any difficulties we may encounter. Services affected: all those on Molotov, including the website, IRC and games servers. The exec e-mail address will continue to function as normal.
