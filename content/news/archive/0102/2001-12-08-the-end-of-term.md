The end of term is upon us, and you've all gone home, and campus is closed. You may be wondering what you're going to do for the next 4 weeks, well, you can hang around on our IRC server, for general chat on \#compsoc, or discussing games on \#games. You could, of course, help with our open source project Lightbikes 3D - any help is welcome\! But, whatever you do in the next 4 weeks, have a good Christmas.
