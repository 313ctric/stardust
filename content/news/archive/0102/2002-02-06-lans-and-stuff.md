Well, LANs are all very well, but we ran out of room on the provisional signup list for s6 in under 48 hours - but never fear - we could be holding a really, no, really, big LAN party at the end of term 3, in week 30. However, we need to know now many people are really interested, so please signup for it if you would like and/or would come to such a LAN (more details).
