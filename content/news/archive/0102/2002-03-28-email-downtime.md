The email system on Molotov will be going down for upgrades at 10pm on Sunday, 7th April. This only affects you if you have a Molotov account and use it for email. No email should be lost, and all other services will continue without interruption. We expect email to be back up and running by 11pm. If you have any concerns about this, please email me.
