Well, here it is at last, the new-look and feel CompSoc website. You should find everything working, including signups for socials\! More will be added to the site over the coming weeks, including an updated technical section, and the minutes from exec meetings.

Don't forget the HTML Tutorial on Monday (5pm, Union North) - it's going to cover tables, possibly frames (depends on time) and the most important thing for any website: CSS.
