There is going to be a CompSoc LAN party on Saturday, week 4 (27 Oct), in Lib1 (next to the library). Unfortunatly, all of the 18 places have already been taken, so we can't accept any more signups (unless you want to be on the end of a 5 long reserve list\!). However, if you just want to see what a LAN party is like, feel free to turn up just to look round (without your computer, of course).
