### Compsoc Exec Minnits

#### 7 November 2001

#### Present

  - Jake Staines
  - Tom Cropper
  - Chris Smith
  - Alexis Birkill
  - James Ross
  - Richard Colfer
  - Henry Southgate
  - Tom Ward

Before starting the meeting, various members of the exec familiarised themselves with the term \`\`moebius’’, with regards to Jake’s onion ring.

#### Molotov

At the time of the meeting, Henry and Tom had bee nto see Chris Tilbury personally, but gained no success. H and T to go and see him again before the end of the week.

Phil Stoneman has leant Compsoc the camera in order for the server to be photographed.

#### s4 Booking

Tom and Jake have both booked the rooms; no reply has been received from room bookings yet. Henry to mail to chase them up.

#### Tourneys

Chispy will be the overall tournament organiser. The tourney will start with a free-for-all round, and then proceed to a bracket system.

The entry fee for the tournament will be a piece of confectionary. The winner will take most, with a small amount going to the second place player.

Chris also to talk to the caretaker about power; an approximation gives us 20 people in one room and five in the second.

#### Karting

H has rung the people but couldn’t get through. To keep trying.

People on the exec who would like to go:

  - Alexis
  - Chris
  - Chrispy
  - Jake
  - Nutsy
  - Toaster
  - James Ross

Tom Cropper to look into duty of care forms.

#### Capital Budget

Still no reply has been heard. Chris Smith to keep pestering and see Jon Finnis. If no satisfactory result occurs then we will go to the boar.

#### Gaming

We are now in ITS011. And apparantly the games are crap and we need new ones. Like Starcraft.

#### Campus Gaming

We’re gonna wait for Molotov before we do anything.

#### Clothes

Henry to write a piece on the newsgroup to see if there is any interest in Compsoc clothing.

Jake to put up a trial picture.

#### Website

The website is not ready to go yet; by Monday it should be OK. The menus aren’t dynamic at the moment, as that was a hefty task in itself.

#### CAT 5

We’re doing quite well with CAT5 sales - David Apthorpe is \`\`Busy’’; Alexis to keep chasing.

We’ve sold more cable to Stuart and Toaster; this is a good thing.

#### Munny

All the money from memberships has been paid into the union. Jake to give the stubs to Ann Jarvis.
