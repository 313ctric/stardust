Well, term 3 is almost upon us, Warwick Piazza almost works, and CompSoc are planning more events as usual... this term we're planning: 2 LANs (one of them will be big), possibly a BBQ (if we can arrange it), and the usual quota of 2 gaming sessions and one open source project meeting a week - that's 27 events total. Oh, and while you're trying to work that calculation out, you would be strongly advised to get yourself a shiny website password, which you'll need for signing up to events from now on.
