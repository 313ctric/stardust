Well, we've had s6, we've all screwed up our sleep patterns, and now we have a new Exec too. So, here they are:

President: Henry Southgate, Vice President: Adam Bowen, Secretary: David de la Motte, Treasurer: Chris Fanning, Socials Secretary: Tom Cropper, Technical Consultant: Phil Stoneman and Webmaster: James Ross.

So, don't forget to slap... um.. congratulate them next time you see them... if you ever see them again...
