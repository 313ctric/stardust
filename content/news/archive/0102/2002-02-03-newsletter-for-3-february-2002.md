### Newsletter for 3 Feb 2002

#### Compsoc Mini-Newsletter

Hi, Everyone\!

Only a short newsletter for you this time, to spread some info on what’s been going on recently; we’re going to Laserquest on Wednesday, and we’ve got our own shop\!

1.  Laserquest
2.  Shop
3.  Molotov Accounts
4.  Gaming

#### 1\. Laserquest

Compsoc go to Laserquest\! Just a reminder that we shall be going to Laserquest this Wednesday, 6 February - that’s This Wednesday\!. We’ll be meeting up at 2:00 in Rootes Reception, leaving at 2:15. The cost will be 5 pounds - but remember to bring your NUS card\!

Signups are online at http://www.warwickcompsoc.co.uk/, so put your name down and let us know you’re coming.

Laserquest, Wednesday, 2:00 Rootes Reception. Be there\!

#### 2\. Shop

After six months of downtime, the Compsoc Shop is now back online (http://www.warwickcompsoc.co.uk/shop/). The store will contain most of the CS coursebooks - certainly all the ones you’ll need - as well as a wide range of reference books, fiction, videos and CDs.

The shop works with the online store [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk). You pay as much as you would with them - absoloutlely no extra - and Compsoc will get a cut. This will help us to keep our events free, and to buy more equipment for you, our members, to use\!

If you’re after an item that is not on the shop, mail the exec (exec@warwickcompsoc.co.uk), let us know, and we’ll add it for you.

Support your society\! Compsoc Shop: http://www.warwickcompsoc.co.uk/shop

#### 3\. Molotov Accounts

We’ve been hearing reports of some of the automated emails not being sent correctly. If you are one of the few cases where this has happened, please let us know ASAP and we’ll endeavour to sort you out. We apologise for the delay, but it is only in a few very special cases :-)

If you have not registered for a molotov account (that’s our server :) then you can do so online at http://www.warwickcompsoc.co.uk/cgi-bin/accreq.pl

#### 4\. Gaming

ITS gaming is sill happening on Friday and Saturday nights, from 10:00pm - 4:00am (you don’t have to stay the whole time if you don’t want to\!) We usually meet up around 9-ish in the Airport for beer beforehand, so come along and join us.

Games played range from the fast and frenetic Quake to the controlled tactical mayhem that is Starcraft, passing many others inbetween - Ignition, Doom and Lightbikes to name a few.

ITS Gaming, Airport, 9:00, Friday and Saturday evenings.

That’s it for now. Look out for the next newsletter which will include details of the next LAN party (provisional signups are up; more details to follow), plus much more\!

Have Fun,
