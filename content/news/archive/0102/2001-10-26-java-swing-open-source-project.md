On Sunday week 4 (28 Oct) CompSoc will be having it's first tutorial for this year: and it's about Swing - Java's Graphical User Interface (GUI). It will be from 1-3pm in Union North, Meeting Room 2. Also, the first Open Source Project meeting will be Sunday week 5 (4 Nov), in Meeting Room 4/5 from 6pm. Anyone who is even slightly interested is encouraged to come along as we will have people from last year explaining what we decided upon, you will get to see current state of the program, and you can find out what you can help with.
