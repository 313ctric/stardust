It's week 4 now, and we've already done a lot this term, but don't fear if you've missed out - there's plenty more still to come\! We, as always, have our twice weekly gaming sessions at 10pm (9pm in the airport) on Friday and Saturday nights in ITS011 (under L3), and the open source project is still going at 6pm in Meeting Room 6, Union North, every Sunday.

And that's just our regular events... we also have a Laserquest outting planned for Wednesday week 5, and the Allnighter LAN party (including the CompSoc AGM) from Friday to Sunday at the end of week 7. As always, all the social information can be found on the socials page.
