If you still happen to be in the vicinity, the WUGLUG are still meeting on Wednesdays and the Techteam are busy setting up our new servers in DCS. Why not pop along? Some gaming and pubbing happen too. More details on the website and on "IRC":http://irc.uwcs.co.uk/. See the rest of you next term. Have fun\!
