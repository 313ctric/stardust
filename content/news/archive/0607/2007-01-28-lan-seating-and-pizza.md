There is now a "drag and drop LAN seating plan":http://www.uwcs.co.uk/society/events/seating/688 - just drag people around and hit "save new arrangement" if you don't like your existing seat.

Also, there is an "experimental pizza order signup":http://www.uwcs.co.uk/society/events/details/713 - please signup and specify your desired pizza in the comments, and the pizza will be ordered sometime before the LAN, thus neatly guaranteeing a sensible arrival time (11pm Friday). Medium pizzas should be a fiver each.

Hopefully, a detailed LAN Plan will be created prior to the LAN with details of LAN social, Downstairs Activities (guitar hero, card games etc) and other fun things. Watch this space.
