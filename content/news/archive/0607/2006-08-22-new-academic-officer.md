Due to many mounting personal issues I (David Byard) have stepped down as Academic Officer. Consequently, I am no longer part of the exec and this position is now re-open for nominations.

If you believe you have skills to bring the society forward - management skills, passion for computing, and a touch of creativity - email the exec with your proposition.

I wish my successor every success and shall make a handover as smooth as possible.
