We're now rapidly approaching the start of the new year, so I'd just like, on behalf of all the exec, to welcome all our existing members back, and to say hello to any freshers who are thinking about joining the society. :)

As some of you may know, the new website is now almost ready, and should be going live reasonably soon, so expect to see a new look. We also have brand new forums, which we invite any and all to sign up for and use.

To anyone thinking of joining us, if you use IRC and want to say hello before the start of the new term, feel free to drop by \#compsoc on irc.uwcs.co.uk and say hi. :)

Kim  
Socials Officer
