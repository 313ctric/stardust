The Society is looking at organising an end of term Paintballing event in conjunction with PaintballSoc. At the moment we are looking at how much interest we get from members before confirming it but initial reaction has been positive. Before we can decide how to run the event we need members to decide if they want to do a full day or a half day at the event.

The event will take place on Saturday 23rd June (10:00-15:00 (full day), shorter if we do the half day).

Approximate cost will be around &£35 for the full day and around &£25 for the half day which will include:

\* Transportation  
\* Equipment Hire  
\* Lunch (depending on when we go and whether its a full day or a half day)  
\* 500 Paintballs

If you are interested in coming to the event (and we want a \*big\* CompSoc team :)) you can "view more details and signup for the event":/society/events/details/775. When signing up for the event, in the comments you should say whether you would prefer to do the half or full day. We will then look at the responses and put together some concrete plans.

Hope to see as many of you there as possible to unwind post exams and give the Exec a good shooting :).
