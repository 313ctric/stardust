The migration of molotov to codd is now complete. All user accounts and services have been restored. Unfortunately the migration took a lot longer the anticipated, due to unforeseen circumstances. We sincerely apologies for the delay and any inconveniences caused.

As some of you may be aware, we are planning on expiring all passwords on codd. This is on order to filter out the weak passwords. If you wish to keep the same password as before, you can change it back by using the passwd command, but if your password is among one of the weak ones, you won't be able to change it back.

If anyone has any problems or queries please contact techteam@ and the issue will be resolved as soon as possible.
