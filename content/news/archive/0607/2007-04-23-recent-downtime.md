You may have noticed that the Computing Society servers have been experiencing difficulties over the past few days. There have been two major causes for this:

\* ITS have been performing upgrades to their network that resulted in an "unexpected service outage":http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/its/newschanges/incidents/network17-apr-2007/  
\* A kernel upgrade to our main server (molotov) resulted in unexpected LVM related failures. We believe that this issue has been resolved, due to it operating as expected since Friday.

We apologise profusely for these issues and any inconvenience caused. We also ask you to bear in mind that we are currently in the process of upgrading our hardware and establishing a redundant setup which should shield our users against individual failure. If you feel that there are any unresolved issues then please email techteam@uwcs.co.uk.
