Thousands of apologies etc., but the previous LAN-related email was in fact incorrect.

It had apparently slipped my mind that due to a room booking issue, the LAN is at the end of week 7, that is, Fri 23rd Feb. The event has been corrected on the website.

Signups will still open at noon this Saturday.

Again, apologies for both the change in date, and the late notice for this LAN.
