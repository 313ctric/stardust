Welcome back to term 3 and the excitement that is CompSoc. This announcement is primarily that Gaming will be returning this Friday at 8pm. It will be preceded by a social in the Rootes Social Bar between 7pm and 8pm. For the more hardcore there is a Techteam meeting from 6pm to 7pm, preceding the social.
