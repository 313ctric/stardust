Just to let you know that the Linux User Group is organising a "pub social":http://www.uwcs.co.uk/society/events/details/679 this Wednesday. We'll be at the Phantom Coach from 6:30pm onwards, for an informal get-together and meal. Everyone is welcome to attend, whether you're a Linux user or not. We'll most likely be staying for the pub quiz afterwards, which should be a fun evening for all.
