Due to the resignation of our Academic Officer (David Byard) over the summer, we have to hold an EGM (Emergency General Meeting) at the start of this term to elect a new Academic Officer for the remainder of this exec period (until the end of Term 2).

The EGM will be held on the Friday of Week 2, most likely in the Union meeting rooms, at 7pm. Further details of the location will be sent out via an email to all society members nearer the time.

Any members interested in running for the position should send an email to exec@uwcs.co.uk with your name, and any handle if you wish, included. Nominations will close at 10pm on Wednesday of Week 2, to give us a chance to email out details for proxy voting (to allow anyone who can't make the EGM to vote) on Wednesday night.

Kim Tibbetts-Harlow, Socials Officer.
