#### Emergency General Meeting

Due to the resignation of the academic officer, we will be holding an EGM to elect a new one on Friday 13th October (1 week this coming Friday) at 7pm in meeting room 3 in the union. All members are invited (and indeed, encouraged) to attend.

Currently standing are Arun Prasannan (Polar) and Graham Hayward (Covbob). If you wish to put your self forward for the position then just send a short message containing your name and the fact that you wish to stand for the position of academic officer to exec at warwickcompsoc.co.uk .

If you do put yourself forward for the position you should expect to make a short (no more than five minutes) speech saying why you would like to be academic officer, and why we should vote for you over the other candidates. You will also be expected to answer a few brief questions from the members present.

#### Terms of Service

The terms of service for Molotov, the server which all of our members have a free account on, have been updated to clarify a few grey areas and reinforce the spirit of the existing terms of service.

The new terms of service are on the website. By using your account you are agreeing to abide by our terms of service, so please make sure you are familiar with them.

#### LANs

Most of the rooms for LANs have been booked, but unfortunately we are having a few problems locating a room for the 2nd LAN of term 2 (week 8 in term 2). Hopefully this will soon be resolved, although it may mean that that LAN is a week earlier or later than usual.

#### Gaming Sessions

Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to sign a contract with ITS for gaming as, with the reallocation of the old rooms we used for gaming, we have nowhere to go. ITS have offered us the new Social Studies IT rooms, however they will not be completed until later this term at the earliest. ITS are also negotiating with the math’s department on our behalf to see if we can hold gaming there, at least temporarily.

More details will be provided as soon as they become available.

#### Socials

Unfortunately, with gaming not happening at the current time there will be no pre-gaming socials until it starts again. Our regular pub socials have already started again and as per the end of last term are in the City Arms. People will be there from 7pm until late, but feel free to drop in and find us, we will usually be in the non-smoking/children’s area at the back on the left, or in the area immediately on the left at the end of the bar.

#### Linux User Group

Linux User Group meeting, as always, is on Wednesdays, so head along to Union North to Xanana’s Lounge or MR6 (They will be in one of the two rooms) between 7 and 10pm. As always if you have any trouble using/installing/fixing Linux on your machine there are plenty of people willing to help.

#### Internet Relay Chat

You can talk to most regular compsoc members, and all of the exec via compsocs irc server. The connection settings are:

  - server: irc.uwcs.co.uk - (if the default port doesn’t work from campus, try 6668 instead)
  - channel: \#compsoc

A windows irc client is available from http://www.silverex.org/download/

#### Cable / Web Hosting

Compsoc provides many services to it’s members including the sale of Ethernet RJ45 cable, and a shell account and webspace on a Compsoc server.

Base charge for a cable is 40p plus 20p per metre. So,

  - For 5 metres: 0.40 + (5 \* 0.20) = &£1.40

<!-- end list -->

  - For 10 metres: 0.40 + (10 \* 0.20) = &£2.40

<!-- end list -->

  - For 20 metres: 0.40 + (20 \* 0.20) = &£4.40

Very reasonably priced, and a lot cheaper than a certain reptilian sounding shop near costcutters.

The shell account on our server Molotov is free, and comes with 20MB of storage and is accessible from the url: http://.uwcs.co.uk . Extra quota is only &£2.50 for an extra 500MB, far cheaper than any hosting provider you’re likely to find. The server is on campus so uploading to it from the residential network/campus machines will be at LAN speeds.
