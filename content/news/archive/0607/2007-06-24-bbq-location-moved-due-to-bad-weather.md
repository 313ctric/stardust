Unfortunately its been raining heavily this morning rendering the chances of running an effective BBQ in a field nill. It is also likely to continue raining, sometimes heavily, during the day. Consequently we are moving the BBQ to Bucko's house in coventry where we can very easily move to the warm indoors during rainy spells. People on campus will be able to get a lift from Tesco at 12.30. Otherwise there is a "map":http://www.bucko.me.uk/images/maptocrosbie.png, which can be used for direction, as maps have been for the past goodness knows how many years...
