Hi\!

LAN seating plan is at "http://www.uwcs.co.uk/society/events/seating/717":http://www.uwcs.co.uk/society/events/seating/717, for what it's worth. I'm afraid it's the same system as last time, and thus totally unsuited for what we'll be up to: I'm afraid I really don't know what the table layout will be.

For now, however, can you update yourselves on it into approximately 6 columns of 5 ish, or 5 columns of 6, or some similar re-arrangement, and we'll see how we go when we do the setup. The bit labelled "door" will be the door closest to the library; there's another door at the opposite end of that side of the room.

Thanks.
