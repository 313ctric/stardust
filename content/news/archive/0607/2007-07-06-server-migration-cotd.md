Earlier today, Codd (the replacement for Molotov) was brought on-line. Our plan was to migrate all data and services across during the course of the afternoon. Unfortunately, while moving user accounts from Molotov, the /etc/passwd file got removed, thus preventing the use of sudo to fix the situation and also any subsequent attempts to log in to the machine. This cannot be resolved till we can gain physical access to Codd - on Monday.

Let us assure you that all your data are safe in the meanwhile and that we will bring all services back on-line at the earliest possible. We sincerely apologise for the continued downtime and any inconvenience caused as a result. Please drop by \#tech on irc.warwickcompsoc.co.uk if you have any queries.
