CompSoc is planning a karting trip on the Wednesday of Week 7 (21st Feb). It will start at 3pm at Mr. Karting, in Leamington, and cost will likely be about &Â£30 (I've not had confirmation of that yet). Transport is likely to be provided by members, so if you have a car, please say so in your signup comments.

CompSoc have a preliminary reservation on the time, but as we need to place a deposit, we need 10 people guaranteed to come before we can justify fully making our booking. There's an "event on the website":http://www.uwcs.co.uk/society/events/details/706.

Please sign up soon if you'll be able to come (they will be keeping the free reservation "for the next few days").
