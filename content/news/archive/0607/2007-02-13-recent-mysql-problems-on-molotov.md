MySQL should now be fully functioning again if you've only been using MyISAM tables (the default). If you've been using InnoDB tables, your database should still exist, however you may have to restore data/table layouts from backups. If you don't have a recent backup or don't have access to your database, please contact techteam@uwcs.co.uk.

Apologies.
