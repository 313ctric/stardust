There's a "clothing order":/society/events/details/774 up on the website. You can get T-shirts, Sweatshirts, Polo shirts, Hoodies and Fleeces - an unprecedented variety\! We have also changed suppliers, so the quality should be higher. Clothing should also arrive before the BFL - so alumni members should have no problem collecting their orders.
