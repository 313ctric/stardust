Once again it's the time of year that our Annual General Meeting comes around. We'll be assembling our conclave later this evening at 1830 in rooms R0.03/04 in the Ramphal building, and I'd like to wholeheartedly encourage you to attend if you find yourself even slightly partial to the future direction of the society. There may be snackies, and in true compsoc tradition a trip to a purveyor of beverages seems likely to follow.

If you've reached term two whilst still unsure of the location of the Ramphal Building, directions to it can be found at "http://go.warwick.ac.uk/interactivemap":http://go.warwick.ac.uk/interactivemap where we hope we can make our presence suitably obvious once inside.

We hope to see you later this evening.
