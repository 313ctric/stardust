Once again we hit that time of term when a weekend can be wholly devoted to the honest, clean and outdoors fun of a good LAN party. For those of you who haven't been before (or in a little while), you might want to read the what to do \[0\] and bring \[1\] guides on the website, an indispensable tool for all potential attendees. I would also like to draw your attention to the Pizza Order \[2\] on the website, which we'll be making from Dominos and should arrive 9 or 10PM on Friday. At 50% off, there surely can't be any drawbacks to having at least two large pizzas to yourself.

Wishing you all a good L4D/Empire LAN,  
Estel  
Gaming Officer
