Good afternoon\!

This is just a final note before tomorrow's trip to watch Star Trek tomorrow to confirm some final details. Hopefully, you've all bought your tickets by now (though there are still some available, according to their website). If you elected to collect your ticket from the box office, it might be advisable to make a note of the reference number before leaving tomorrow.  
As there is no allocated seating, if we wish to sit together we will probably need to arrive quite early, and as such we're meeting at the IMAX at 1300. If travelling from Coventry or Campus, I'd recommend the 1214 train from Canley train station, which should get you to Birmingham New Street by 1245ish, allowing for the 15minute walk to Millenium point (just don't get lost\!). If you arrive later than this and can't find us, feel free to contact me by mobile.

Hope to see you all tomorrow, if not in Varsity in about... four minutes.  
Nathan
