Owing in part to the extended server downtime over the weekend, we'd like to point out that we now have a presence on both "Twitter":http://twitter.com/uwcs and "Identi.ca":http://identi.ca/uwcs where you can keep abreast of society news and information. There is also a "Facebook":http://www.facebook.com/pages/Coventry/University-of-Warwick-Computing-Society/58373841841 page, should you prefer to follow the society in this way.
