### Tech Officer

As Knicos was leaving university for an extended period of time, it was decided that the society needed a new Tech Officer. It was also decided that Brad must be the new Tech officer (mainly because he is already in contact with ITS to deal with their upcoming investigation on network stability). monk also pointed out that there is someone else lined up for the position of tech officer (Jack Ley), but at the moment we really need Brad.

Action: Brad to get the keys to the UWCS computers from Dr, and Dr get Knicosâ€™ set of keys.

### C Tutorials

Dr wanted to organise C programming tutorials in the DCS. It was agreed that these would be held in Week 3 and Week 4 of this term.

Action: Dr to try and book the DCS Labs to conduct this event.

### Gaming Accounts

Action: Brad to give Azurit a shell account in the UWCS gaming servers.
