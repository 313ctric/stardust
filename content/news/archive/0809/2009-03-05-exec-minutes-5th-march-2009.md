### Apologies

## Budget

Monk has not finalised the budget yet. He will present it to the exec  
next exec meeting  
**Action**: Monk to finish budget

## Gaming handover

**Action**: Mulletron will give connorhd and Sinjo the password to the gaming logon for DCS.

Roger said that he would like the phone numbers of the current exec  
so he can contact us if necessary.  
**Action**: Someone to give Roger the phone numbers email

The cleaners are apparently huffing kittens. Either that or they would  
like the gaming to be left spotless after we use it.  
**Action**: Exec to bring binbags to gaming and make sure it is clean  
after friday night, and bin bags to be taken out to bins

Roger would also like to know about the exec a bit more.  
**Action**: Exec to write biographies over easter to be put onto new site

## IEEE Update

The IEEE student chapter is not happening any more, the department are  
not too interested and it is not something we can do on our own.

## Publicity team

A publicity team is not needed til we have something to publicise, so  
at the moment is not necessary.

## Animesoc projector purchase

**Action**: Monk to talk to Pam about money for projector

## Xbox usage

The Xbox360 is not being used enough at the moment to justify buying  
new games. If interest picks up then maybe we can look to buy more.  
**Action**: Xbox360 to pull itâ€™s finger out and come to gaming. Failing  
that, the gaming officer should bring it along to gaming and LANs

## LAN

LAN setup will occur at 7, and the entire exec should be there to help set up.

## RTSsoc

RTSsoc seemed to have dissappeared, and so the Ghosts need to be  
deployed against them.

## Biosoc

**Action**: Sinjo needs to email biosoc about the website that raeped codd  
and ITS to ask about backus ports being opened.

## Equal ops

The exec needed a member of it to be trained in equal opportunities.  
Estel volunteered for this.  
Action: Estel to be equal ops man.

And then there were cookies. :D
