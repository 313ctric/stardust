### Apologies

Claire Thomas (pepper)

## Jobs mailing list

Not enough people are signed up to the jobs mailing list. Mogmiester  
should advertise it in the newsletter  
**Action**: Mogmiester to advertise it

## Holiday newsletter

There are many points that need to be advertised that would be  
forgotten if a holiday newsletter is not sent out  
**Action**: Mogmiester to send out a holiday newsletter

## Academic sponsorship

Connorhd received sponsor info from sadiq and mulletron.  
**Action**: Connorhd to look into sponsorships over Easter

## Amazon associates account

The amazon associates account is currently broken. Connorhd offered to  
look into it

## Tech team meeting

**Action**: Sinjo needs to look into the points raised at last weeks tech  
meeting to see if they were fixed

## Projector

The projector is still missing. Monk should buy it off Anime and look  
around DCS for it, and inquire at the front desk if it has been given  
in or put away somewhere

## Budget

**Action**: Monk needs to finish the budget and email it to exec for it to  
be ratified

## Holiday pub

Sadiq suggested that we do a loliday pub, and has offered to look into  
it and advertise it

## Interuniversity gaming

A good idea would be to have interuniversity gaming. Estel should  
email as many compsocs as possible to gauge interest, mentioning  
Trackmania, DotA and L4D.

**Action**: Mogmiester also needs to ask in the newsletter what games  
people would like to have hosted on a gaming server

And then there were doughnuts.
