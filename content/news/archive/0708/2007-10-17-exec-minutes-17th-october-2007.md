**Present:** Mullet, Si, OddBloke, Fluffeei, Bruce, Brad, Lucy, Monk, Lamby, Sadiq

#### Technical Officer

Brad resigns as Technical Officer stating the heavy workload and issues with the position. There is too much  
work for one person and this creates a long lag waiting for everything to get done.

Mulletron replies that the Exec voted for the installation of two tech deputies but that these positions  
were unfilled. If they were it might lighten the load.

Brad answers that the time consuming task is often getting tasks allocated out and chasing them up as  
needed. This presents a real distraction from getting the job done.

After much discussion the Exec agrees to:

  - Stop further work on LDAP
  - Stop changing user IDs (to be greater than 1000)
  - Continue to fix email problems
  - Look at obtaining Insomnia from ITS

After this Brad agrees to continue in position until a replacement can be found.
