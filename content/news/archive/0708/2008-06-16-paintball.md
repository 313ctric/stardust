Warwick paintball soc have been awesome and organised us one hell of an event for Saturday.

As it happens the paintball ground they use is celebrating its 21st birthday and as such there will be live music, a hog roast and just more epic than your body has room for.

The price of tickets is £43 which is really reasonable considering that you get 1000 paintballs, a smoke grenade and all the other things listed above. It also happens to be a cool £12 less than their ordinary asking price.

So I only ask that you signup "here":http://uwcs.co.uk/society/events/details/946 and "buy tickets":http://www.warwicksu.com/ents/event/5052/ on the union website.  
Hope you all signup and thank paintball for the awesome job they've done.
