The first problem for the Compsoc Progcomp has been announced\! To get started, you'll want to look at http://progcomp.uwcs.co.uk/. It is free to enter and there will be prizes for the best entries.

The deadline for code entry is 2 weeks from now, and there should be plenty of competition, but it is intended to be enjoyable for any level of programmer who wishes to enter.
