Welcome back after the Christmas break. For any refreshers, just a reminder of compsoc's events: We have pub socials on Mondays, WUGLUG on Wednesdays and Gaming on Fridays. If you have not been before, don't worry, we don't bite. Don't forget to sign up to the LAN in week 2\!  
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  
The Compsoc Exec.
