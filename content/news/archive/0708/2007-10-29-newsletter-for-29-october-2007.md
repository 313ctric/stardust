\-- WUGLUG Lightning Talks

The Warwick University GNU/Linux User Group (WUGLUG) will be holding lightning  
talks this Wednesday 31st October on the following topics:

\* Daniel Watkins (Odd\_Bloke) on the LaTeX Beamer presentation tool

\* Chris Lamb (lamby) on the Git revision control system  
\* Tim Monks (monk) on the Vim text editor

The meeting will be starting at 19:00 in A0.23. However, as it is a little  
tricky to find, a small group will be meeting people outside the Department  
of Computer Science at around 18:50, intending to leave at around 18:55.

More details can be obtained from the WUGLUG's IRC channel:
