**Present:** Mullet, Si, OddBloke, Fluffeei, Bruce, Lucidion (Lucy), Brad,

##### Purchases

Si asked if all future Society purchases can go through the Exec.  
Generally purchases are supposed to be discussed by the Exec prior to  
the orders being placed, this helps with accountability and budget  
management.

##### WUGLUG Budget

Exec agreed this would be 70 GBP.

##### LAN Planning

Faux said that no one has specified a setup time.

Fluffeei noted room is booked from 20:00 so there may not be any spare time.

Lamby reported that the tech team rota was OK for the LAN.

##### Talk Promotion

Mullet told the Exec that the promotion for the Functional Programming  
talk had been OK but needed to be improved for future talks.

George put this down to late room booking on the part of Si.

##### Communication in Minutes

OddBloke stated that lack of minutes was not helping Exec meetings.

Si replied that he was working on it, major focus had been on covering  
the academic talks, posters and other Exec related trivia.

IBM sponsorship invoice.
