See [last week's minutes](https://uwcs.co.uk/news/week-11-term-2-exec-meeting-minutes/) for a summary of where we got to

Stage channels are pretty cool. We'll decide what to do about keeping the channel permanently at some point, doesn't really matter.

### Discord Layout 2: Electric Boogaloo

#### IRC continuation

  - General thing from \#participation-discussion was the cliquiness of IRC/the server in general
  - First years wanted somewhere where they could talk to each other but also a limited number of older years as there are a lot of graduates etc in the server.
  - Having a "directory" giving a description for each channel would be a good idea which may help with some of the thoughts about what channels are for. Potentially merge with \#roles? I.E. here's these channels and what they are. if you want to join click here.
  - Link to academic channels discussion (**ACTION POINTS BELOW**)
      - rename \#first-year to freshers
      - rename academia/undergrad channels, move \#second-year and \#third-year to public archive
      - rename \#fourth-year to \#masters

#### Renaming \#exec???

  - Has this been raised before? This is mitigated by many other things we are thinking of doing e.g. channels guide, rewriting guide to discord
  - \#exec will be used more often for public discussion
  - Bi-annual general meeting anyone??
  - **Nope**, not renaming. Moving on..... (please save me)

#### Info & Announcemnts

  - Idea: rename \#opportunities to \#sponsors, only sponsored posts. Any other external posts go in \#external-announcements.
  - No opposition, move on (**ACTION: do above point**)
  - Merge schedule and announcements? \#schedule can't get buried with announcements etc. **No**
  - Rewrite message in \#welcome? Probs needs updating, maybe something to look into behind the scenes. Generally is updated once a year

#### Misc stuff

  - Remane misc to optional/opt-in, make everything in it opt-in (besides \#bot-commands and \#exec)
      - \#opt-in-channels for getting access to channels, opt in channels in alphabetical
  - Having voice channels near top is good, makes us look active :D
  - Move \#bot-channels and \#exec to general category -\> **YES DO THIS** (who knows if we decided on this for \#tech)
  - \#tech -\> mainly general tech, not compsoc specific stuff.
  - Aka bunch more opt in channels and category channels to allow opt in? Descriptions of each channel will go in there \<- **THIS**
  - Group \#music and \#media into one role
      - Kinda separate, division is fine. **No change**
      - \#anime is separate because I say it is and koalas have the final decision
  - Merge \#sports and \#f1?
      - \#sports is very dead.
      - **Do this** - rename \#f1 to \#sport, remove \#sport or whatever its name is.
      - Pls someone tell Faux about this, please (also change bridging to using ID as opposed to name
  - Some channels in archive we can remove e.g. old announcement channels that were never used **DO THIS**
  - \#game-design or something on that line for people to talk about game design/development etc
      - \#gaming still fine for this?
      - could just give it a channel and see how it goes. already exists in irc?
      - **ACTION:** build a little road (aka channel) and see if anyone takes that path (aka if anyone uses it). fits in gaming category best

#### Academic

  - Summary of this: why do we have so many channels for the same thing? What is the distinction between \#academia, \#computer-science, \#undergrad and year channels?
  - Rename some of these? Discussion
      - Rename \#undergrad to \#university and make it more general uni stuff for everyone. This would cover most use cases for the current year channels.
      - Rename \#first-year to \#freshers and \#fourth-year to \#masters as mentioned above (see what happens to \#masters in terms of activity)
      - \#academia stays
      - \#postgrad stays, and keeps it name (you win Alex)
      - \#computer-science to something like \#computing sounds better
      - What to do about \#second-year and \#third-year? With the pomegranate hopefully ending we may see more activity. Anyone can see them.
      - We shouldn't be considering other servers as factors here. We don't represent ALL CS students..
      - We may have a year where everyone comes to UWCS for discussion
      - **Decision - DO THIS**:
          - \#undergrad -\> \#university/\#students (General)
          - \#academia -\> \#other-academia (move to bottom of channel)
          - \#computer-science -\> \#computing
          - \#first-year -\> \#freshers (General)
          - \#second-year
          - \#third-year
          - \#fourth-year -\> \#masters
          - \#postgrad

#### Gaming

  - Archive the dead channels, these will be visible (\#animal-crossing and \#openttd)
  - Do we need a system to decide when to archive? Not much mental strain. If things are role-gated, leave them unless they receive no activity at all then archive.
  - Leave a message mentioning we are planning to archive explaining what's going on.

#### Archives

  - You will be able to opt in to view archives if you want. **Do opt-in archive**
  - Deal with any private channel currently sitting there, but otherwise just do that.
  - \#exec-history? **Nope**

### Any other business?

#### Please? Anything?

  - Shrek is happening. Amelie will post to FB
  - Review IRC bridging behind the scenes for config changes to the IRC Bridge
  - Move Academic stuff again because this meeting has gone on way too long and I'm hungry
  - Need to consider joint event with Tabletop? Some Minecraft event?

### Quotes and memories of whatever a "meeting" is

"That's a constitutional change, moving on" - Ryan

"Someone resign, we'll have an EGM and change the constitution" - John?

"A good idea but Discord says no" - Ryan

"tell me what to think, please" - Amelie
