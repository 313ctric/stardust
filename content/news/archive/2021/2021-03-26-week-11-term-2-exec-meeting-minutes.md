### Discord Layout

*Link to initial ideas/prospective changes:* [Discord changes - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lcArcGa8oQsuP4BIsct1AA6oY72oK1wc1KrjzAUkyOo/edit)

#### Membership screening

  - Introduction to Discord
  - Specifically looking at "community servers" new feature.
  - Would not affect current users, nailing down what new users need to do/be aware of before taking part.

#### Intros

  - Suggestion to remove \#intros and change bot to introduce in \#general, for example.
  - Don't create a separate \#grad-intros channel
  - Decisions: Don't keep \#intros, don't create \#grad-intros, keep welcome messages

#### Rules/Code of Conduct

  - Start pushing people to content-warn potentially-upsetting content
  - Would we need a "not-exhaustive" list of CW ideas?
      - Tabletop doesn't have a list
      - Pushing people to edit, so they get an idea over time.
      - There will be a transition period.
  - In general, anything NSFW
  - In general it's a bit subjective as to what could be triggering.
  - Reminder that we are a student platform, but we shouldn't need to justify ourselves.
  - Where would this list go?

<!-- end list -->

  - A lot of the things in our rules/CoC are also in Discord's guidelines.
  - Purpose of our rules is it is stuff that applies to all events, virtual and in-person, that don't necessarily happen on Discord.
      - This year is a bit of an exception with a lot of activity existing in Discord
  - More changing how it is presented rather than the content
  - **Action**: take a look at CoC and see if anything needs a rewrite?

#### Roles

  - Currently \#roles at top of Discord, split by categories, react gives/removes roles.
  - Other than opt-in, roles don't serve much of a purpose
  - RE split into multiple channels: separate important and optional roles so you do see important roles first
      - Counter: most do find the important roles anyway
  - Focus of this discussion is on those who are new to Discord etc.
  - Other role changes:
      - Split @postgrad into @pgr and @pgt
          - Change for role and channel
          - Specifically PG-Taught and PG-Research? Nope
              - Quite long
              - Widely used terms
              - Put description in role menu rather than in name
      - @Physics, @Biology, @Chemistry, @Engineering -\> @Other STEM
      - @Business, @Humanities, @Social Sciences -\> @Non-STEM
          - Summary of this: anyone can take DCS modules. At what point do we feel we have too many/too little channels?
          - Keep Direct DCS courses (everything to Data Science) as separate roles then group otherwise similar to above?
          - Strawpoll?
      - Add @prospective-student
          - Channel for prospectives to ask current students questions? Not needed all the time.
              - \#undergrad?
      - Remove @garrys-mod, @jackbox, @film roles
          - @film merged with @social
          - Agreed\! Let's move on please as I'm losing my sanity... :D
  - Generally follow Slack model (important channels available to everyone, everything else opt in)
      - May look a bit unsightly but its the best option we have right now.
  - Remove BDFL/ex-exec colour
      - Ex-exec don't have any powers in the server, they are listed in the exec history
      - Limit colours to years/course roles + exec

#### IRC

  - Whatever happens, we need a \#general
  - Point of \#freshers is for first years to go/meet people -\> repurpose \#first-year
  - Just make and see if they get used? Was requested by freshers as there wasn't a starting area for them with their peers.
  - Worth trying and looking at the end result
  - Hmm it's already 6.50...

Continue original agenda at next meeting in a week

### Other things for now:

  - More public exec discussion in \#exec
      - General discussion etc to move public? General pinging to stay private (e.g. write the newsletter\!)
      - Anything discussed resulting in an action is discussed in a meeting anyway. General planning in front has previously normally been in private.
      - Don't put sponsor stuff public\!
      - Mundane convos used to happen in person, however that can't happen because of a certain pomegranate going on right now.
      - Perhaps a \#exec-readonly channel where discussions happen publicly?
      - Does everyone need to comment on stuff right from the initial idea, if everything is discussed publicly later?
      - Action: do something I don't know....
      - Real action: cut out everything that can be public and put messages to get exec to make it public. But otherwise sit and think and see what happens
      - Amelie's action point: improve \!reminder command so they don't default to other reminder bots.
  - Shrekathon date: poll to go up shortly

Move Academic events section to next meeting whenever that may be

### I'm lost...

"That was the sudden shrek scare" Ryan (slightly paraphrased as I forgot the quote half way through typing...
