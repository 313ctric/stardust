Good timezone to you all, my fellow beings\! Come and grab a seat ahead of the perusal of this week‚Äôs newsletter\!

### **What happened last week?**

Short answer: a lot\!

Long answer: a lot\!

#### *Nettitude CTF*

Wednesday saw our Capture The Flag event happen, and a massive thank you to Nettitude for coming and running this event for us\! We had lots of fun working on a range of challenges within a web environment, involving techniques such as decrypting data, SQL injection and gaining root access to Linux environments to capture the flags. It was a great event for all\!

This week was also a week full of events run alongside [Tabletop Society](https://www.warwicktabletop.co.uk), with our annual Eurovision watch-along and an unexpected Pondcon occurring\!

#### *Pondcon*

Unfortunately, due to the ongoing pandemonia, our usual CompSoc vs Tabletop laser tag frenzy couldn‚Äôt take place. However, a miracle occurred that meant a bunch of members across the societies managed to get vaccinated last week, and combined with the recent easing of restrictions, the two societies decided ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs all gather near a pond and all meet for the first time in a year\!‚Äù And it was here, at this moment in time, that Pondcon was born\! Oh, and don‚Äôt ask me who came up with the name because I don‚Äôt know :D

Pondcon was a fun-filled extravaganza of a 2 hour (maybe?) event, which involved standing around meeting people (many for the first time\!), debating whether the ground was too wet to sit down on, and Ares feeding the ducks and birbs (although we later found a sign saying not to feed the ducks‚Ä¶ sshhhh, don‚Äôt tell anyone that part). Yes, it was birb club\! If you are interested, ‚Äúshockingly reception is poor by the pond‚Äù according to Amelie when Sam video-called Amelie to see everyone. There was also a lot of ‚Äúwait, are you so-and-so on Discord?‚Äù, because we all know I‚Äôm a child and haven‚Äôt met anyone before...

In summary, the first in-person society event was a success\! Identities have been exposed and we now all have superpowers. Let‚Äôs hope Pondcon 2: Electric Boogaloo can come soon\!

#### *Eurovision - written by Hannah, Co-Op Officer at Tabletop*

Once again, tabletop society and UWCS did a joint event for Eurovision this year. Done over discord streams due to a little thing called the ‚Äúongoing global pandemic‚Äù, it was possibly the most chaotic five hours I‚Äôve ever spent in a discord call (rivalled only by the fabled Centaur Discourse). We had many, many, *many*, bingo cards, which was a fun experience for me desperately trying to predict what would happen with no prior knowledge of Eurovision solely from other people‚Äôs cards. Mostly, this meant going ‚Äúwhy do so many of these mention twinks?\!‚Äù

After just barely managing to organise things in time for the main event, we had 26 songs of variable quality, over the top ridiculousness, horny bond villains, and dubious greenscreen, along with the bot almost dying right before announcing our scores. Through it all, we took comfort in how this event brings people from across the world together to give the UK the zero points we deserved, with neither the jury nor the public giving us anything, to the resounding cheer of everyone in the voice call.

After living through the many chaotic had many glorious nations present to give their verdicts on the songs, from Alcoholism to Amislav, the former Soviet Socialist Republic of Somerset to ***Trans***ylvania, everyoneelseistan to ‚Äúsome points I found on the floor after the actual Eurovision was done‚Äù, but in the end we managed to piece together some results (with Daisy singlehandedly giving the UK infinitely many more points than the entire rest of Europe combined):

In conclusion, it was an extremely cool event (and one that will hopefully be in person next year\!), even if the consequences of being on a voice call until midnight are slowly catching up to me\!

*Josh side note: a massive thank you to Alex for hosting our Discord bot and running the stream for this, and to the exec involved from both societies for organising this event\!*

### **We need you\! (yes you there with the blue shirt at the back)**
