Naturally, due to the ongoing state of the world, it will be run online and as such, the exact format is yet to be decided with advice being given from the SU.

The positions available are:

  - President - The representative of the society
  - Secretary - In charge of the administrative details

## Friday Gaming

Term has started again and that means gaming is officially back on\! You may have noticed it lived on during the holiday, but now it's actually official again. We will be playing video games, probably some Jackbox. Maybe even TTT.
