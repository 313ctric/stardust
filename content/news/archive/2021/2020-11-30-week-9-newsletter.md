<p>Week 9 Newsletter</p>

<!-- more -->

Hello Everyone\!

It's time for more newsletters\! I may have emailed you a lot lately, but there are lots of very interesting and important things to tell you.

## Advent of Code

As we enter the month of December, the annual set of Christmas themed programming challenges get underway at <https://adventofcode.com/>\! Every year we often have a good amount of people taking part so we have a group leaderboard setup to track our progress - for more info on how to join that and what the challenges are like, we've got a little primer for you available at <https://go.uwcs.uk/aoc>. We've renamed the progcomps channel to \#advent-of-code, where we'll be discussing the problems and potential solutions in a variety of different languages (make sure to be careful for spoilers if you take a look in there before you've done the daily challenge\!) There may even be a few members streaming writing their solutions in the lobby if you want to drop in there from time to time\!

## Friday Night Gaming

Now that LAN is over, we're going back to our regularly scheduled Friday Night Gaming sessions this week, where we're going to run some of **TTT2, Mysterium, Golf It\!, Minecraft** or **Prop Hunt**, depending on what people want to play on the night\! As always, if you don't feel like playing one of these games, we also have the lobby open where you can chill and chat or play (or stream\!) some other games\!

## Insomnia Pub Quiz

Normally at Insomnia every year there's a great pub quiz that happens, however due to the current circumstances this cannot happen so they're running a Christmas themed quiz live on Twitch from 8pm on Sunday\! Normally we all form a large group and jump into one of the VCs on the night, come and join us then\! More information about the quiz can be found on Facebook: <https://www.facebook.com/events/364048918312193/>

## Schedule

That's all from me for now\!
