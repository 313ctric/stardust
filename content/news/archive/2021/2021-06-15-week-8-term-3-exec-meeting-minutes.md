#### Other things

  - Server will be turned into usual LAN sate.
  - Remember to announce tournaments early enough for downloads to happen (blame resnet)
  - We should probably not call it a LAN? Easy to describe it, hard to succinctly describe it
      - Post Exam Events - PEE.
      - How about Post Exam Extravaganza?
      - Loads of other more memorable versions.
      - It's called PEE... (in the announcement)
      - Summer LAN with tagline is the final decision
      - 3 of the 7 present exec voted for PEE. Let that be known,

#### Advertising

  - Discord, Facebook, WISA.
  - Any other soc discords?

### End of Term Social

  - Phantom Coach - 6pm Monday wk 10 (28th June)?
  - COVID?
      - options are really requiring 2 negative tests and/or a vaccine.
      - we don't really want to make this decision but it will be on our conscience if COVID were to spread
      - LFD tests aren't the most accurate but do provide *some* protection.
      - question now is do we make this an organised thing or not?
      - we have no confidence with this really.
      - cancel booking, people can unofficially go if they want and take the risk themselves.
