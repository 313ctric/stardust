Our database is one of the largest in the world. It processes a billion transactions daily - more than the London Stock Exchange and Visa combined.

After 22 years of success in the UK, TPP is now expanding their offering to deliver connected care to new markets in China and the Middle East. We're currently hiring for seven different graduate roles and for our 2020 summer intern programme.
