## London Stock Exchange Group Talk - 3-5pm, Wednesday 4th November

We've got another talk this week from from **3-5pm** on **Wednesday 4th November**, this time it’s going to be with the **London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG)**. It’ll be hosted as a Teams live event and should hopefully give insight into how LSEG power their systems. The details for the talk are as follows:

London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) is one of the world’s foremost financial market infrastructure and capital markets groups. As a global leader in financial technology, LSEG continues to play a pivotal role within the financial markets during these challenging and unprecedented times.

Join David Gavini, Head of Development at ForexClear, for a virtual event on 4th November from 3–5pm to find out more about how technology powers a clearing house. You’ll get the chance to put your questions to David, and a member of our recruitment team will also be present to answer any questions you might have about our technology spring week, internship and graduate programmes.
