### **WASD Summer**

As many of you may already be aware CompSoc runs WASD (Warwick‚Äôs Awesome Speedruns and Demos) - an annual charity speedrunning event that has taken place annually since 2016. This year, we are starting a sister event: WASD Summer, which will take place remotely on the **13th and 14th of August 2021**.

#### *When and Where*

WASD Summer will take place on the 13th and 14th of August, and will be streamed live to the WASD Twitch account: <https://www.twitch.tv/warwickspeedrun>

#### *Signups*

The event is open to anyone, student or otherwise. The only requirements are that you are able to run a game reasonably quickly, and can support a stream of your event. If you are interested, signups are now open over at <https://warwickspeed.run/signup>

#### *Want to learn more?*

### **Summer LAN**

Summer LAN/BFL/whatever we call it is a thing and will be happening during Week 10\! That's **28th June to 2nd July** for those of you who want dates.

For those who are unfamiliar, LAN stands for Local Area Network - we‚Äôd normally gather in a large room in the Library (or so I‚Äôm informed), bring our computers and have a fun time chatting, getting to know others, and generally some video games too\! The sort of things you can expect to see at LAN include:

  - A range of tournaments - feeling competitive? Well, you've come to the right place\!
  - A quiz - get ready to test your knowledge of everything\!
  - A movie night - who knows what movie or how it will go, but hey, it's a movie\!
  - Board games - fancy buying everywhere in London, or teaching me other games? This is great for you\!
  - A music server - perfect for all your listening needs
  - Just general playing games and chatting\!

Due to the current global situation, we will be holding Summer LAN virtually in our [Discord server](https://discord.uwcs.uk). There‚Äôs no obligation to stay for the whole time\! While there will be lots of time for gaming, do feel free to just come and chat with us.

Make sure to mark those dates in your calendar ahead of a fun & pizza filled week\! We'll be announcing events running that week soon so do keep an eye out for more info\!

### **Merch\!**

  - *Clothes:* Shirts, Hoodies
  - *Stickers:* UWCS crest, Pride UWCS crest, UWUS crest, Flag, Mascot, Pronoun badges?
