Hi Everyone\!

Another LAN week is here\! My favourite time of term. So just forget your worries for a weekend and have some fun.

## G-Research Coding Challenge - Thursday (6-8pm)

The challenge will involve you competing in teams of 3-5 people to build a natural language calculation engine (no prior NLP experience required). The challenges will cover things like evaluation of arithmetic expressions to unit conversions and equation solving.

To register, just fill out the form at <http://bit.ly/code-challenge-nov>. G-Research will allocate teams the week before the event (or if you would like to join as a team with friends, just let them know when you register).

Once the game is complete, you will have the opportunity to stay online for some virtual networking where you can discuss the event and life at G-Research with members of their team.

There'll be prizes for the top three teams, with each member getting an Amazon voucher - **£50 for first place, £25 for second, £10 for third**

*Whilst it says on the signup form that it's for penultimate or final years, we've had clarification that they won't be strict on this, so anyone can join in\!*

## Frosty the SnowLAN - Friday 6pm to Sunday 6pm

LAN this weekend\! Running over this weekend (Beginning on the 27th November) on our Discord Server. We'll be rearranging it as before. Come and *chill* with us in the lobby, we'll have the music server available again and we're running tournaments and a quiz\!

There may also be some *unofficial* events running throughout the weekend organised by our member, such as impromptu tournaments, multiplayer sessions and film nights. \#lan will be on the top of the channel list throughout so be sure to keep an eye on it\!

## Coming up soon

### Advent of Code - December

A bunch of us often take part in a programming competition over the course of December, where we get a sequence of difficult challenges with a '*Christmassy*' theme\! Like every year, it'll be starting on **December 1st** at <https://adventofcode.com/> and we'll be discussing our solutions in \#progcomps\! It's a great time to learn or practice with a new language and stretch your brain every day\! We'll have a leaderboard for members of the society to join and take part alongside us, keep an eye on \#progcomps for that.

## Schedule

That's all from me for now\! See you at LAN,

Toby
