## Gaming

Games continue to happen\! Thank you to those of you who helped out with the Divinity Original Sin 2 multiplayer test. Though ultimately very chaotic, it does open the door for a potential proper game with more people which could be quite enjoyable\!

Regardless, come along to the Discord on Friday for many many games, wonderful people to chat to and a great time.

### And now, a word from our sponsors

TPP is a global digital health company. With over 5,500 organisations using our solutions to care for over 50 million patients, our software is used across all health and social care settings, including GPs, emergency departments, hospitals and mental health services. This means that wherever and whenever a patient needs care, a detailed and up-to-date record is available. No other company has a digital healthcare solution on this scale. Our database is one of the largest in the world. It processes a billion transactions daily - more than the London Stock Exchange and Visa combined.

After 22 years of success in the UK, TPP is now expanding their offering to deliver connected care to new markets in China and the Middle East. We're currently hiring for seven different graduate roles and for our 2020 summer intern programme.
