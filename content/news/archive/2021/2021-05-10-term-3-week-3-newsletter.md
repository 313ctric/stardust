<p>It&#x27;s week 3 and I&#x27;m ready for more of doing nothing except writing this newsletter!</p>

<!-- more -->

G’day mate\! Welcome to this scorcher instalment of the UWCS newsletter\!

#### **Lightning Talks**

*Mon 10th @ 7pm*

Tonight at 7pm we have our next instalment of Lightning Talks\! We will have a lovely set of speakers for you, speaking for about 15 minutes on a topic of their choosing. There will also be an infamous “karaoke talk”, where the slides have been written by someone else and the speaker will be seeing them the same time we all do. These will be held in our Discord server and I’m sure it’s going to be a fun time for all\! See the image below for the titles of our talks\!

#### **Nettitude CTF Event**

*Wed 19th @ 2pm-6pm*

Nettitude will be running a remote capture the flag (CTF) event, over MS Teams.

The event will last 3-4 hours in total, consisting of:

  - A short presentation about Nettitude and the penetration testing industry
  - The main CTF event (of course)
  - Announcing the winners, then an interactive Q\&A

*You don't need any prior knowledge or experience\!* There are flags for different skill levels, and hints will be given throughout.

Before the event, you'll need to set up a Kali Linux VM (up-to-date, and with tools installed). You can find a guide for installing Kali Linux here: [<span class="underline">https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/</span>](https://www.kali.org/docs/installation/)

If you need any help with this or have any questions, head over to our [Discord](https://discord.uwcs.uk/) and we will be more than happy to help.
