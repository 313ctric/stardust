          - A tad quiet but not too bad
          - Generally people are just tired and interest has waned. This is more of a global thing
      - Gaming
          - Keep an eye on things, try ideas that we come up with.

          - Advice for handover/future: Having people present their own rounds is a great idea
      - Movie night

      - Next Wan
          - Week 8-ish?
          - Maybe an Indie game/Flash thing would be fun
  - Request for \#stonks (or similar) to split up discussion in \#world-of-work
      - Unless this becomes a frequent issue in the world. It is a small enough thing that it can stay in \#world-of-work
  - \#animal-crossing and \#league-of-legends appear to be dead
      - General standard for when to axe channels? I.e. x months without activity?
      - How to deal with associated roles/role menu?
      - Archive them, keep an eye on the others.
  - \#politics
      - For now, leave it be. It's easier to keep it all in one place.
      - Make a note for future exec that it is worth keeping an eye on.

          - Status update for the society
          - Normally talk about some finance stuff - Purchases,Income, Growing Scrooge McDuck money pool
          - Maybe worth having a look back further so people who may not know but may be standing know how the society operated before covid

              - Potentially some lined up
              - Constitution changes (to be voted on) need to be declared by this Friday
