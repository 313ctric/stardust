As the motions passed on annually selecting a society motto, flag and mascot, we now are looking for your submissions\!

  - The motto should be a short sentence or phrase.
  - The flag should be an image using a standard vector graphics format (e.g. SVG).
  - The mascot can be any person or concept, fictional or non-fictional. Please do not submit members of the society, university, or staff without their permission.

Submissions for each category can be submitted to Thomas via DM on Discord before the end of **Sunday 7th March** (that's this Sunday\!) Please note that submissions are subject to approval by the exec, and that they are expected to follow our rules and code of conduct (i.e. nothing NSFW/NSFL, derogatory, or defamatory). After the submission period has ended there will be another week-long voting period on approved submissions.
