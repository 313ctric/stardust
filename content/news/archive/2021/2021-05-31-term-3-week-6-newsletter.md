This year, we are starting a sister event: WASD Summer, which will take place remotely on the 13th and 14th of August 2021.

#### *When and Where*

WASD Summer will take place on the 13th and 14th of August, and will be streamed live to the WASD Twitch account: <https://www.twitch.tv/warwickspeedrun>

#### *Signups*

The event is open to anyone, student or otherwise. The only requirements are that you are able to run a game reasonably quickly, and can support a stream of your event. If you are interested, signups opened today and you can now signup over at <https://warwickspeed.run/signup>

### **We still need you\!**

Thank you so much to those of you who have completed our questionnaire so far about UWCS and inclusivity within the society (and the Computer Science department if you have had any interaction with them). We‚Äôve already started to take a look at and reflect on the responses, and if you haven‚Äôt already, please do consider taking a couple of minutes to complete the questions.

Whether you are a graduate or student, or whether you've been to our events - regularly or one off - or not at all, we want to hear from you. All responses to this survey are completely confidential and will only be seen by the current exec, and no personally identifiable information is collected.

If there is anything else you want to mention to us, if you have any queries, or just want to chat to one of us one-on-one, feel free to drop any one of the exec an email or DM on Discord. In particular, you can contect Ella, our Women‚Äôs Officer and Equal Opportunities Officer, me (Josh), our Welfare Officer, or Amelie, our President. You can find our contact details below. Thank you again for taking the time to complete this\!

### **Summer LAN**

Summer LAN/BFL/whatever we call it is a thing and will be happening during Week 10\! That's 28th June to 2nd July for those of you who want dates.

For those who are unfamiliar, LAN stands for Local Area Network - we‚Äôd normally gather in a large room in the Library (or so I‚Äôm informed), bring our computers and have a fun time chatting, getting to know others, and generally some video games too\! We also try to get some board games along, and there‚Äôs no obligation to stay for the whole time\! Due to the current pandemonia situation, we will be holding Summer LAN virtually in our Discord server. While there will be lots of time for gaming, feel free to just come and chat. We might even watch a movie together or do a quiz\!

Make sure to mark those dates in your calendar ahead of a fun & pizza filled week\! We'll be announcing events running that week soon (TM) so keep an eye out for more info...

### **Merch\!**

In case you missed it, we‚Äôre hoping to do a merch order in the coming weeks\! We are looking into offering the following for everyone to choose from:

  - *Clothes:* Shirts, Hoodies
  - *Stickers:* UWCS crest, Pride UWCS crest, UWUS crest, Flag, Mascot, Pronoun badges?
  - *Badges:* Pronoun badges
  - *Flags:* Flag
  - *Ducks:* Ducks

Because of ongoing exams, we now plan to open orders in a couple of weeks once the majority of the exec have finished for the year. However, do not fear, you can use this time to think up a world in which you own CompSoc merch\!
