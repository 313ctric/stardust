<p>It&#x27;s yet another week and that means it&#x27;s time for yet another newsletter!</p>

<!-- more -->

Well hello there\! Gather round, fellow friends, for this week’s instalment of the UWCS newsletter\!

#### **Emails are fun…**

Well it turns out I still don’t like the SU email system, and due to some technical difficulties beyond our control the newsletter managed to be sent via email twice last week. This time it really wasn’t our fault… But our sincere apologies for it\! If you want to guess how many times we will manage to email it out this week, come make your guesses in our [Discord server](https://discord.uwcs.uk)\!

(If it’s any consolation, I am now out of £10 because of the email sending twice…)

#### **Nettitude CTF Event**

*Wed 19th 2pm-6pm*

A reminder that Nettitude will be running a remote capture the flag (CTF) event, over MS Teams.

**Unfortunately sign ups are now closed.** However if you have signed up (thank you\!), please remember you'll need to set up a Kali Linux VM (up-to-date, and with tools installed). You can find a guide for installing Kali Linux here: <https://go.uwcs.uk/kalivm/>

If you need any help with this or have any questions, head over to our [Discord server](https://discord.uwcs.uk) and we will be more than happy to help.
