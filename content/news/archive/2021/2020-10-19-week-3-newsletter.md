Hello CompSoc\!

Exciting announcements this week so lets get straight in.

## LAN - Week 4 Friday -\> Sunday

You may be asking the question here "LAN? What is LAN and how could it be?" Well let me start by assuring you that we aren't going to try and run an in-person event like that yet. To answer the question: LAN is a bit like Friday Night gaming, but bigger, better and for a weekend.

From **Friday 6pm (30th Oct) to Sunday 6pm (1st Nov)** we'll be playing games and running events.

We'll be starting LAN like normal Friday Night Gaming with some organised games. Then we have a couple of tournaments and a quiz planned. LAN is a great time to grab some friends and have a weekend of fun. In addition we have a remote music server setup for LAN called Amphi. It allows everyone at LAN to watch the stream at the same time and CompSoc members to link youtube videos to the queue. The tradition of music servers at LAN has been cherished for many years now and always creates a great atmosphere.

Due to the remote nature this time. We'll be running it on our <https://discord.uwcs.uk> which has just about everything we'd need to put on a great remote event like this. If you have any questions about the event don't hesitate to get in contact with any of the exec by our usual channels.

## Optiver Talk

Next week on Tuesday (1pm) we'll be hosting a talk by Optiver on C++ code optimization. I'll make sure to have the important details about how to watch the talk to you in the next newsletter so in the meantime. Clear a little space in your calendar for what I'm sure will be an interesting insight from an industry leader.

## Friday Night Gaming

Following last Friday's success we're going to keep trying the two game model\! One main game to get started with and then a nice secondary game to branch into.

This weeks games will be **Among Us** (Free on mobile, cross-platform to paid on Steam) and various Jackbox games (a set of party games you can play from your phone) .

As always, feel free to suggest other games in our Discord if there's anything else you want to play\!

## Schedule

That's all from me for now\!
