<p>It&#x27;s week 2! And I will try not to send this out via email multiple times this week...</p>

<!-- more -->

Ahoy there, matey\! Welcome aboard this week’s instalment of the UWCS newsletter\!

#### **About last week...**

Yeah, we had some issues with the SU’s wonderful, so technically advanced, email system again, meaning that we managed to email last week’s newsletter 3 times to everyone. If you got any more or less than 3, please pray to our SU overlords and you might end up with an email…. But really, we’re sorry this happened and we hope it doesn’t happen again\!

#### **Nettitude CTF Event -***Wed 19th May 2pm-5pm*

Nettitude will be running a remote capture the flag (CTF) event, over MS Teams. The event will last 3-4 hours in total, consisting of:

  - A short presentation about Nettitude and the penetration testing industry
  - The main CTF event (of course)
  - Announcing the winners, then an interactive Q\&A

*You don't need any prior knowledge or experience\!* There are flags for different skill levels, and hints will be given throughout.

Before the event, you'll need to set up a Kali Linux VM (up-to-date, and with tools installed). If you're not sure how to do this, we're here to help in the chat\!

***Signing Up***

We need to know the names and email addresses of all participants before Friday 14th May (that’s in just under 2 weeks\!). If you're happy for the email and preferred name listed on your UWCS account to be used, please sign up using: <https://uwcs.co.uk/events/nettitude-capture-flag/>

If you want us to provide a different name and/or email, or do not have an account on the UWCS website, please contact one of the exec via email or Discord.

#### **Lightning Talks -** *Monday 17th May 7pm*

Next Monday at 7pm we have our next instalment of Lightning Talks\! We will have a lovely set of speakers for you, speaking for about 15 minutes on a topic of their choosing. There will also be an infamous “karaoke talk”, where the slides have been written by someone else and the speaker will be seeing them the same time we all do. These will be held in our Discord server and I’m sure it’s going to be a fun time for all\!

#### **Eurovision event with Tabletop\!**

It’s getting close to that time of the year again - yes it’s Eurovision month\! Closer to the time of the final, we will be setting up a joint server along with Tabletop, and on the night will provide a place for everyone to watch the final along with our signature commentary provided by Sam and Alex. I am personally yet to experience this but I hold very high expectations\! At the end of the final, we will all do our own point giving where everyone is a representative of their own fictional country.

#### **This week in UWCS**

Again, there’s not a lot on this week but here’s our schedule\!

1 week down, only 9 more to go\!

Hope you all have a lovely week\!

Josh
