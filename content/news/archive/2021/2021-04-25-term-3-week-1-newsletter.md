<p>Term 3 is among us! Here is the newsletter for week 1!</p>

<!-- more -->

Oh hi, I didn’t see you there\! Welcome along to this week’s instalment of the UWCS newsletter\!

**Let’s get things straight…**

You may have noticed that I am not Toby, and you would be correct in that assumption. I am in fact Josh, a loving 1st Year CS student and your new secretary for this year\! I’ll be writing these newsletters for the next year and also minuting our exec meetings, which means repeatedly losing my sanity and regaining it at a later time. I’m sure it will all go fine. Nothing can go wrong, right? Right?

**Handover\!**

As you can probably gather, the exec handover has now officially happened\! The new exec has been in “power” for the past week and so far have not managed to burn anything down yet. Need a reminder of who the new exec are? No need to panic, below is a list of us all and our Discord usernames. You can find out more about us over on our website: <https://uwcs.co.uk/about/exec/> or come chat to us in \#exec over in our Discord\!

**Discord Changes**

Speaking of Discord, you may have noticed there have been a few changes over in our Discord server recently. Most notably, we have had a re-jig of some of our roles, and have made more channels “opt-in”, allowing you to choose which channels you want to see and/or participate in.

If you haven’t already, make sure to head over (the link is [discord.uwcs.uk](http://discord.uwcs.uk/) if you aren’t already a member\!) and check you have the roles for the channels you want to see. The best channels to check are \#new-roles, \#opt-in-menu and \#gaming-menu. If you have any questions feel free to drop us a message in \#exec and we will be more than happy to help you\!

**Friday Night Gaming returns\!**

This Friday evening sees the return of our weekly Friday Night Gaming\! Come and join us in the voice channels in our Discord, have a chat or enjoy playing some different games together. There’s no obligation to stay for the whole time, just pop in for a bit and say hi\!

**Coming up this term\!**

To be perfectly honest with you, I hate exams. However, here at UWCS, I am sure a lot of us share the same, if not a similar sentiment. Therefore we have the pleasure of making sure we can distract ourselves from these dreaded exams throughout this term\! Here’s a quick look at what we have coming up this term:

  - Monday Week 3 we have our next set of Lightning Talks\! While topics are yet to be finalised, we will have a lovely set of speakers for you, speaking for about 15 minutes on a topic of their choosing. There will also be an infamous “karaoke talk”, where the slides have been written by someone else and the speaker will be seeing them the same time we all do. These will be held in our Discord server and I’m sure it’s going to be a fun time for all\!
  - Wednesday Week 4, Nettitude will be running a Capture-The-Flag event with us\! This will be a 3-4 hour event held in the afternoon, with an opportunity to show off your technical abilities and also learn more about what Nettitude do. We will announce a confirmed start time once we have it.
  - Monday to Friday Week 10 brings us our amazing Summer LAN\! Due to the current global situation, this will be online in our Discord server, alas there is no need to doubt that this won’t be a fun-filled week full of gaming, events, (virtual) pizza and stuff going wrong as always (not just because I’m there)...

**Merch**

So I’m too young to remember any time we’ve brought merch together but apparently this has been a thing in the past, and we are currently looking to do another merch order soon\! We’ll let you know the exact details in the near future, but we are looking at buying t-shirts, hoodies, stickers and flags. Keep an eye out for more\!

**This week in UWCS**

There’s not a lot on this week but here’s our schedule\!

With the start of the exam season imminent (or already started for us first years), we wish you all the best of luck in your exams this term (and I’m sorry again).

(I now have the greatest search history in the world)

Hope you all have a lovely week\!

Josh
