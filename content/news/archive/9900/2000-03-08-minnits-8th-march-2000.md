It was suggested that we list our CSV gaming sessions in the Word. It was decided that we already have enough interest.

Pre-gaming social in the Airport at 9pm is to be arranged for this Friday onwards. It was suggested that someone check the NT room next to L3 to see how many people were either working, or playing CounterStrike. This information would be needed if we decided to try to extend our sessions.
