Greetings CompSoc

We have a few messages for you about some issues which occurred during  
LAN.

We are also in possession of a grey jumper which was left by Table 1 at the  
end of LAN, so contact cranman if it's yours.

Firstly, we are concerned about state of Table 3 at the end of LAN. There  
was food trodden into the carpet under the tables, which made the clean-up  
a lot harder to complete. Please ensure that you leave your seating area  
in a clean manner, as it's unfair on the people cleaning up at the end. We  
will be monitoring this at the next LAN, with potential bans for people  
who don't keep their area clean.

We also had a few issues of people sleeping at LAN. We are not allowed by  
Warwick Security to permit people to sleep at LAN for health and safety  
reasons. We had people bringing camp beds into LAN. We cannot allow this  
to happen, so if you're tired, go home and sleep.

Lastly, there was a case of someone using someone else's equipment without  
having permission beforehand. There is a level of trust between everyone  
at LAN, including the safety of an equipment left whilst you aren't there.  
Please don't take something without first asking as we will have no choice  
but to ask you leave LAN.

Sorry to be such a killjoy, but this is for the benefit for everyone.

The Exec
