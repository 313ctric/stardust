Greetings CompSoc\!

Firstly, as DCS is having an Open Day this Saturday, and the room has been left in a less than perfect state after gaming recently, there will be NO FOOD AT GAMING THIS WEEK. That's STRICTLY NO FOOD ORDERS as well, so eat beforehand this week.

Secondly, our AGM is next Wednesday. I'll be sending out another e-mail once the room has been confirmed, but if you're thinking of applying for a position, please send your manifesto to secretary@warwickcompsoc.co.uk BEFORE MONDAY. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch at the same address.

Web Hosting  
\=========================================  
If you're interested in hosting, you'll want to go to http://uwcs.co.uk/member/  
and fill in the request form for a shell account. You'll need to make a separate  
request for database account (a MySQL account) if any of your sites use that (for  
example WordPress).

Further Info  
\=========================================  
If you have any other questions, http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/faq/ is a good place to  
start, and you can always drop us a line at compsoc-exec@uwcs.co.uk.
