Greetings CompSoc\!

I'm getting to touch to let you all know about our first LAN of the new year. If you haven't been to one of these before, details can be found on the website here: http://www.uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/gaming/lans/

If you're a fresher, then I have good news for you, LAN signups are already open\! Places can fill up fast so if you want to come along, make sure to sign up soon.  
Signups for regular members open on Friday 29th of October.

Can sign up and view details of the event here: http://www.uwcs.co.uk/events/details/1246/

We also have the usual pub and gaming this week. Feel free to come along to one of our exec meetings too, if you're feeling really enthusiastic\!

Web Hosting  
\=========================================  
If you're interested in hosting, you'll want to go to http://uwcs.co.uk/member/  
and fill in the request form for a shell account. You'll need to make a separate  
request for database account (a MySQL account) if any of your sites use that (for  
example WordPress).

Further Info  
\=========================================  
If you have any other questions, http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/faq/ is a good place to  
start, and you can always drop us a line at compsoc-exec@uwcs.co.uk.
