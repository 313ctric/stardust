A huge welcome to all of the new members of the Computing Society, and an equally large welcome back to our members from last year\!

Now that Term 1 proper has started, we are pleased to announce the first of our Academic Talks.

It will take place this Wednesday in S0.11 at 6:15pm and will be about "Getting the most out of your Shell Account", a highly useful topic especially for new Computer Science students. The speaker will be Chris Sinjakli (Sinjo on IRC), and there will be pizza provided.

So come along\!
