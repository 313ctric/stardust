Hello members\!

For those of you who didn't already know, the Fresher and Member sign ups for the first LAN of term are now open.  
The first LAN of the year is always a good one, so we recommend signing up soon\!

(Sign ups for non-members will open on Friday 5th November, one week before the LAN starts).

If there are any games that you would like to see played, speak to either Tom (TeamDoherty) or Nick (Agaeki) so we can add them to the schedule.
