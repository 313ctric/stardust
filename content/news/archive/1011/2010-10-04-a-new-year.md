Welcome to uwcs.co.uk, home of Warwick's Computing Society\!

This year promises to be an exciting one, with academic talks lined up from IBM and Bloomberg, our popular programming competitions, and our awesome weekly gaming meetings in DCS.

We have a stall on the Thursday of Freshers' Fair, so come along and say hi, and receive goodies from us and our sponsors\!
