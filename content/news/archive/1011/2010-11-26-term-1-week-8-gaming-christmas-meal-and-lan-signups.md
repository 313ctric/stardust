Hello CompSoc\!

A few things this week:

As we have our Christmas meal on Friday, gaming is not officially taking place this week. We apologise about the short notice about this.

You should come along to the Christmas meal instead if you can\! It's at Wing Wah's, an all you can eat buffet and starts at 19:30. I hope to see you there\!

Also, LAN sign-ups for the week 9 LAN are now open. A pizza order should be added to the website soon too, for those who want to order something to eat.

and fill in the request form for a shell account. You'll need to make a separate  
request for database account (a MySQL account) if any of your sites use that (for  
example WordPress).
