Greetings CompSoc\!

First things first, a big thank you to everyone who helped to clean up after our first LAN of the new year, I hope all the attendees had fun too.

Secondly, we have a few events going on you might be interested in:  
\-We have a guest speaker from IBM speaking on the topic of “A New Dimension of Computing” this Wednesday.  
\-Our traditional Christmas meal on Friday 26th(Friday week 8) at Wing Wah's.

There may only be a limited number of places for the Christmas meal so sign up sooner rather than later.

Also, we want to remind our members of our Terms of Service of codd accounts:
