Greetings CompSoc.

As the AGM is soon, I wanted to inform you about the elections for exec positions in the society and how to apply. I know some of you have already sent in manifestos after I announced this at LAN, don't worry, there's no need to re-send those (Unless you want to of course).

Please send your manifesto to secretary@warwickcompsoc.co.uk. Your manifesto should cover who you are and why you want to be elected to a position in the society. There is no limit on the number of positions you may run for, although please note that you need to be a current member (not associate member) of CompSoc to be elected.

Another e-mail will be sent out containing the date and location of the AGM when it has been arranged. Manifestos of applicants will also be posted on the website.

The positions are as follows:

\*Academic President (Co-President)\*

The role involves keep the academic activities of the society running including academic talks and technical services. Both president positions have a responsibility to oversee the budget working with the secretary and treasurer on general society matters.
