Greetings CompSoc.

I hope everyone had a pleasant holiday and is ready to start attending CompSoc events again.

Sign-ups for our next LAN are open, taking place on the weekend of week 2. (That's Friday 21 Jan - Sunday 23 Jan)

There is an Exec meeting on Friday this week too, which are open to all members of the society.  
If you're thinking of running for a position, then I recommend coming along if you can.

We also have our usual Pub social on Mondays and Gaming on Fridays. Hope to see you there.

Web Hosting  
\=========================================  
If you're interested in hosting, you'll want to go to http://uwcs.co.uk/member/  
and fill in the request form for a shell account. You'll need to make a separate  
request for database account (a MySQL account) if any of your sites use that (for  
example WordPress).

Further Info  
\=========================================  
If you have any other questions, http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/faq/ is a good place to  
start, and you can always drop us a line at compsoc-exec@uwcs.co.uk.

Regards,

Sigma D (Robert Steele)
