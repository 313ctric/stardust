#### LAN

Signups for the LAN are now full. IPs at the LAN will be allocated using DHCP, so if your PC is on Piazza (or DHCP is used in your house) you won’t have to change any network settings. DNS will also be available to make finding other peoples’ PCs easy.

See you there,

Euan.  
Computing Society Secretary.
