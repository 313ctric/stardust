Molotov has now been upgraded with the components left over from the Insomnia upgrade. Thus our servers are now:  
Molotov  
AMD Duron 950  
512Megs PC133 RAM

Insomnia  
AMD XP2200+  
1024 Megs PC2300 DDR RAM

There will probably be a Molotov reboot in the next little while, when we upgrade the kernel so we can use lm-sensors to find out how hot its getting. Other than that the latest round of upgrades is pretty much finished. The VPN works, the new IRCd is running smoothly, and the hamsters are running fast enough in their wheels to cope with at least another 10 webpage requests per second. Message ends.
