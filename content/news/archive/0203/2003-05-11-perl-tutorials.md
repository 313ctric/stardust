Hi\! For those of you who didn't know, Perl tutorials are happening on Wednesdays in the Union Meeting Rooms (see the Socials Page for more details on locations).

The tutorial notes for the first tutorial are now up at http://www.warwickcompsoc.co.uk/\~bucko/perl/. Sorry about the lack of sophisticatedness of the page.
