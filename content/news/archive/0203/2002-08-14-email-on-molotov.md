Those of you who use molotov for your email will have noticed that email's been broken for a week or two. This is now fixed. Email posted to @warwickcompsoc.co.uk will be delivered correctly. Users wishing to post by using molotov should set their mail client to use smtp authentication with their molotov username and password, on port 8025. POP3 still works as normal on port 110. Email compsoc@warwick.ac.uk if you have any queries.
