#### 0\. Server downtime

Having upgraded Insomnia to an Athlon XP 2200 and 1GB of RAM, we’ll be upgrading Molotov on Monday 9th (in week 8) between about 12:00 and 14:00. Molotov will be going from a Pentium 3 500 with 256MB to a Duron 950 with 512MB.

#### 1\. BBQ

The sun is (sometimes) shining and the paperwork has been completed, so there’ll be a BBQ on Sunday 22nd at 4pm. For those who have been to a CompSoc BBQ before, we’re in the same site (site number two). This is located at the bottom of health centre road, just follow the plume of smoke :) You don’t need to sign up to attend this event.

#### 2\. LAN

Following the BBQ will be the BFL, which starts with a Pre-LAN on Monday 23rd in LIB2 at 19:00 and then expanding to include LIB1 from Tuesday 18:00 onwards and finishing on Thursday at about 21:00 (to allow for cleaning up). Signups for the Pre-LAN and the main LAN are open from midday Tuesday 10th (week 8) for members and from Monday 16th (week 9) for guests.

#### 3\. CounterStrike

Some of our members (e.g. Chris “MFJ” Endicott who ran the previous Piazza based CS server) are organising a CounterStrike tournament to be held in week 9, and will be using Insomnia to host the games. Watch this space and \#cstourney on our IRC server for more information.

#### 4\. Next year

Expect more guest lectures and other potentially exciting events next year, such as a programming competition and tutorials from the LUG (e.g. setting up a gateway for your house). If you have an idea for an activity you’d like to see organised, send it to the exec at the address above.

#### 5\. CAT5

We are still selling lengths network cable - all at a very cheap price.

Prices are:

  - 50p base
  - \+50p/m up until 10m
  - \+40p/m for cable \> 10m

e.g. 20m would cost you: 0.50 + 5.00 + 4.00 = 9.50

Mail cat5@warwickcompsoc.co.uk with your requests, and we’ll sort you out ASAP.

That’s it for now, good luck with your exams and we hope to see you soon.
