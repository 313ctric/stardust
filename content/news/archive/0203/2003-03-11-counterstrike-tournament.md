This Friday (Week 10), The Computing Society will be holding a Counterstrike gaming tournament in aid of Comic Relief.

Entry fee: Â£2.00  
Time: 10:00 pm  
Location: ITS0.11, under L3 (Near Getech)  
Bring along: Your own headphones, and money for bribes

The server operators will be accepting reasonable bribes, so the evening promises to be full of mayhem and fun\! After all, how many other societies give you the opportunity to kill people for a good cause? ;)
