...commence\! In less than a week, CompSoc will be holding the first LAN for this term - and we want you there. Starting next Friday 8pm, and going on until Sunday 10pm, with signups up at 12 noon today\! Expect the usual fun, with up to 32 people in the room, and lots of multiplayer games - it's certainly an unique atmosphere.
