By the time you all read this, the new server will be installed and working fine (I hope\!). If there are any problems with the new setup, please mail me. Those of you with dynamic PHP scripts will need to change them; for details, go to http://www.warwickcompsoc.co.uk/molotov/php.cps.  
We will, at some point, have pages further detailing the services that Molotov MkII will offer you.
