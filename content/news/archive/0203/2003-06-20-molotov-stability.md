As many of you will have noticed, Molotov has crashed for the second time in quick succession. Luckily, the Technical Team were able to get in to the server room and restart things within a few hours.

We are not certain as to the cause of the failure at this stage. However, we have replaced a suspected faulty component with a known good one. We will continue to monitor the situation, and take any steps necessary to guarantee availablitity of CompSoc services.

It is likely that Molotov will suffer from a short period of planned downtime before the end of term, so that we may replace any components required at that time.
