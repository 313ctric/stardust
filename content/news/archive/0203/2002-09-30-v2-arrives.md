And, finally, it's here. The new version of the CompSoc website... and by Bob it's taken some effort. I expect it will be a bit odd to navigate at first, since the main changes have been to do with the organisation of the pages - hopefully it's a bit more logical now (yeah, I wish :) ). As always, you find something broken, incorrect, or just any comments generally, send them on the back of a postcard, to J.G.Ross@warwick.ac.uk.
