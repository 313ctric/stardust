In order to provide better services for our members in the coming academic year, we're intending to replace the machine that is currently being 'molotov' with a brand new, sparkling, funky server. Or something. Anyway, the net effect is that services will be unavailable for a period from about 5pm onwards on Thursday (22nd) until midday-ish on Friday (23rd). Any changes made to data on molotov (eg IRC and user accounts) may not be stored. I will post another news item once everything's done. Mail me with any problems or queries.
