We are pleased to announce that our games server, insomnia, has (eventually) been installed onto the Piazza network. We are in the process of setting it up to provide numerous services, including a variety of games servers. If you have any suggestions for games or other facilities this server could provide, do not hesitate to contact the exec.

Update: Insomnia is now running Q3 (both original \[on port 27960\] and the OSP mod \[on port 27961\]) as well as a UT server. These can be accessed from q3.warwickcompsoc.co.uk and ut.warwickcompsoc.co.uk.
