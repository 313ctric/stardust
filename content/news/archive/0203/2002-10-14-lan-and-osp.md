Just a reminder for those who don't know; we're holding a LAN party this weekend, from 10am Saturday until 10pm Sunday. So for all you guys who expressed an interest at the Fresher's Fair, why not bring your PC along, and try kicking our arses? Details on the social events page.

Our OSP (Open Source Project) is coming along ok, but we need a new one this year... we're holding a discussion (ok, argument more like) in Cholo 3pm this Wednesday. This meeting is to discuss the relative merits of the ideas put forward on Sunday's OSP meeting, so come along if you want to be part of the new OSP (or complain if you can't make it).
