Welcome to the University of Warwick Computing Society's Webpage\!

If you're a member, welcome - and thanks for joining the society. If you missed us at Fresher's Fayre, or have just decided that you'd like to join, the kind folks at Union North will be only too happy to sign you up.

Our first social is this Friday, at 7:00 in The Airport ("The Bar"). Afterwards, we'll be heading off to ITS for the first gaming of the year, so feel free to come along and join in\!

You can log in by clicking the 'Members' item on the left and then 'Log in', using the password and membership number that was mailed you recently. Use this to access the range of facilities provided on the site - including signups for our very popular socials\!

Anyway, that's about it for now - have fun\!
