Over the past week, and it particular on Saturday 12th, the network connection between the Students' Union building (where Molotov is located) and the rest of the University network has been having some problems. It should be noted that Molotov has been up and running the whole time, although access to it has been intermittent. We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused, but unfortunately this situation is beyond our control.
