CompSoc's second guest talk of the term is taking place this Wednesday (23rd of Novemver), courtesy of CoreFiling Ltd.

The talk will be taking place in S0.18, from 1pm, about "Using Machine Learning To Solve Real-World Problems"

"How do you approach a classification problem involving thousands of categories rather than the 'usual’ five or six? What happens when your data-set is several gigabytes and growing? What open-source tools are available, are they any good, and can they be put to commercial use? How do you measure the system’s effectiveness when you’re not allowed to see the real data because of client confidentiality?"

David North, from Oxford-based software company CoreFiling, will aim to answer all these questions and more in a talk on machine learning from an industry perspective."

Hope to see you all there\!

Alex Wilson

UWCS Academic President
