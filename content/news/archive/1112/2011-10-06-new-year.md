Hello, one and all.

It's the start of a brand new year, which means new people, new places to visit, and all manner of interesting things for the society.

Events will be continuing as normal from next Monday (which is our "Fresher Pub", so don't be late and not get a seat\!), but as mentioned at the Fair, there is NO GAMING THIS FRIDAY (the 7th October).

However, Gaming will resume next Friday, the 14th.

See you all around

Alex Wilson

UWCS Academic President
