After the success of last term's talk on Machine Learning, we have organised another guest talk courtesy of CoreFiling.

The topic of this talk is **Real World Version Control**, which will be of special interest to the students currently embarking on the CS Group Software Project.

The talk will take place in L5 (on the Science Concourse) on the 15th of February, from 5pm until 6pm.

"A talk about how version control is vital to software development and an introduction to some of the ways it can be used in a commercial context to deliver high quality software. Topics will include: a brief history, benefits of version control, pitfalls and common misconceptions, typical work-flows and tool support. The talk will last approximately 45 minutes and there will be an opportunity to ask questions."

Hope to see you all there\!

Alex Wilson

Academic President
