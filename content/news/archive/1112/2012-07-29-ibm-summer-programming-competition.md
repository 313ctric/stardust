This summer the University of Warwick Computing society is pleased to announce a summer long programming competition to write an AI for the game Bomberman\!

Entrants have the summer to write their AIs which will be scored during the final week before term starts. Make sure your AI is running during this week\!

The top three AI writers will be awarded a fabulous prize - we have a Kindle, an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi up for grabs with the winner getting first choice. They'll also be invited to IBM Warwick\! The prizes will be awarded during a prize giving ceremony/networking session during the start of term 3. We'll also be giving out really cool mini solar powered cars to people to entered the competition at this event\!
