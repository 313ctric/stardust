# Marmite’s Musings

  - Getting up earlier than is absolutely necessary is madness. Giving in to your body saying it’s time to get up is weakness.
  - We don’t trust the NSA, or any government organisation, to make anything secure. This is why we make everything ourselves (if you’re reading, hi NSA\! We love you guys. Please don’t send drones after us. Also, this Christmas we want a pony).
  - Maddy: adblax has lush hair. Advice to adblax: be careful around maddy and scissors.

# Academic

# Gaming

  - LAN rota to go up with smaller slots
  - Possibly move 1st LAN next term to week 3 or 5 to avoid FOSDEM
  - Update LAN advice page with wire handling info
  - Xmas decorations at LAN
  - Mr Marshall’s suggestions dscussed. Splitting society into academic/gaming rejected, primarily on financial, logistical and organisational grounds. Possible ideas for making gaming more accessible include integrating suggestions into planned facebook group, updating and expanding the steam group, possbily running a mumble server, running more events with xbox representative, esports spectator events (barcraft), being listed on activities & games section of SU website, working with SU to avoid creation of fractured gaming societies, and future discussion of a possible name change to UWCGS: Computing & Gaming Society.
