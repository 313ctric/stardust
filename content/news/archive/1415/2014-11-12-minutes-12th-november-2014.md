# Marmite’s Musings

  - Our esteemed Treasurer is not to self approve use of society funds on hookers and blow. Even if it is a way of life.
  - CompSoc is not a military, and we don’t hand out medals for service. Or ribbons. Sorry Veltas.
  - Befriending the Socs Fed has borne fruit, as we got LAN sorted, and the Socs Committee actually rejected an application to do something we already do.
  - Business school students wanting CompSoc members to provide free app programming may be subjected to ‘Robot’s Den’ as a test of their fortitude.
  - We are the US in our ‘special relationship’ with WGD. We’re still not a military though.
  - Maddy is building a new comupter. Please tell her horror stories about everything that could go wrong.
