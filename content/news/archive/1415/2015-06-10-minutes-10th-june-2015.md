Marmite's Musings: I'm on 2 hours sleep and have an exam tomorrow. Stop expecting wittiness from me you vultures.  
Wordart is underused.

Marmite's skeleton notes, to be fleshed out later when he's less braindead:

\-More detail on discussion, clearer conclusions in minutes  
\-Gokarting money collection, should be doable manually, aim to finish by friday gaming  
\-BFL: newsletter for signups, plan out events/tournys, get hands on controllers, rota to come  
\-Open day: something informative & engaging (wordart\! explosions\! - hermit), something interesting but broad on academic side (web hosting package with database access, not shell stuff as is current)  
\-Marmite and mcnutty to meet monday 15th  
\-Rockets planned to have all components running by tuesday 16th for a weekend launch  
\-Lemon will let department know about open day volunteers (basically various execs)  
\-Ask DCS to be mentioned in freshers' communications  
\-Get posters, flyers all printed and paid for
