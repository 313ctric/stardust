### Why do I need to do this?

For ✨security✨...

From August 2021, GitHub announced they would not be allowing password authentication
when using the command line to interact with GitHub.com [^1].

This means that in order to interact with GitHub from the command line you have to
create "authentication tokens".

### What are authentication tokens?

> An Authentication Token (auth token) is a piece of information that verifies the
> identity of a user to a website, server, or anyone requesting verification of the
> user’s identity.
