Supported by a grant from the Rust foundation, this four-week course introduces Rust to those already familiar with another programming language. Throughout the course, you'll be developing some cool projects - starting with Tic-Tac-Toe in the command line, then writing a Chip-8 Interpreter, before finishing off with a Graphics Raytracing project. Runs in Term 1 (22/23)!
