A six-week introductory Python course, created alongside Warwick AI and Coding and running in Term 1.
We're responsible for Week 1 (Variables, Datatypes, & Debugging) and Week 6 (Efficiency, Compactness, Readability). Clearly saving the best for first and last! We also worked jointly with AI to create "Wahoot", the overarching project.

Looking for booster sessions? We run them with ChemSoc in Term 1, and PhysSoc in Term 2, tailoring the content to meet their course.

We'd also recommend checking out [this tutorial](https://howtoprogram.dcs.warwick.ac.uk) from the Department of Computer Science as a good starting point.
