# Resources

For all our tutorial writing needs. 

Text-only tutorials can just go in their own Markdown file. If you want to include multiple images in a tutorial, create it a directory and write the content in `index.md` (note not `_index.md` as that denotes a section). See Git Good for an example.

Remember to edit `resources/_index.md` to reference the newly created tutorials -- soonish will make this generate from content.
