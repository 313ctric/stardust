# Admin

Ignore this directory, it only exists to generate the CMS pages.

If you want to add a new shortcode to the editor, do that as shown in `_index.md` -- though this is still jank.

Edit `themes/uwcs/templates/admin/config.html` to actually change the CMS config.

The CMS does still need quite a lot of work
