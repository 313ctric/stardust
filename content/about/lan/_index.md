An FAQ on our LAN Parties
<!-- more -->
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is a LAN Party?**

A LAN party is an event where everyone brings their computer to a big
room to all play games together and eat unhealthy amounts of junk food.

**What does LAN stand for?**

LAN stands for Local Area Network which is what we are all connected to
while at these events.

It basically means we\'re all connected by ethernet cables for superfast
connection speeds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How often do LANs take place?**

In the first two terms we run two LANs in each. These usually happen
around weeks 4 and 8, but check our events page to be sure. In term 3 we
run Summer LAN instead, and that takes place from Monday to Friday Week
10.

**How long do they last?**

Our LANs all last 48 hours (Friday evening to Sunday Evening) with the
exception of Summer LAN, which lasts 104 hours (10am Monday to 6pm
Friday).

**Do I have to be there the whole time?**

No! Especially during Summer LAN; that would not be advised. LANs are
drop-in events, and there will always be a member of exec in the room,
supervising and keeping an eye on your belongings. Feel free to come and
go as you like.

**Can I sleep at LAN?**

You cannot sleep at LAN (security don\'t like it)

If you intend to attend a large proportion of LAN, please make sure to
shower before the event.
