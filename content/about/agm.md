> Whether you've been linked to this page or stumbled into it, the first thing I'd like to say is that I'm sorry. All of the information you'll ever need to know about the AGM/Elections, and more, is contained on this page. Not all of it will be relevant to you, and we'll try not to get too bogged down in edge cases, but do be aware this isn't a smooth read. - Keegan

### What is an AGM? Why is an AGM?

An AGM, or Annual General Meeting, must be held in Term 2 by every society. It's not always called that, but it's meant to be an event where the society looks back on the year's events, and looks forward to how it wants to plan things in the future. 

Unless you're on the exec, want to be on the exec, or are extremely fun at parties, that probably doesn't sound like an appealing event on its own. So like most sane societies, we use the AGM to:

- run society elections 
- vote on motions
- get feedback on the past year of events
- stuff everyone full of free pizza üçï

Why are we doing this? Because we're a Warwick SU society, and have to follow [Regulation 9](https://www.warwicksu.com/your-union/how-the-su-works/governingdocuments/) (don't click on that if you value your time). And just like bread, we don't want to have any stale and/or mouldy exec members around for too long.

### Where and When is our AGM?

OC1.07 7pm Feburary 29th

### Who can take part in the AGM?

Any member of the society! Even if you're not standing, how you vote or what you say could drastically affect the direction the society takes in future.

*the number of slots given for each position is only a recommendation, as the new exec can use the Shared Office clause to take more or less than this.

### Voting

We use the STV, or [Single Transferable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) system. For each position, you can rank as many candidates as you want in order of preference. The system works in elimination rounds. If your preferred candidate is eliminated, your vote will be transferred to your next non-eliminated preference until a single candidate remains.

You can also vote to Re-Open Nominations, by selecting a candidate affectionately labeled as RON. Note that RON is an active vote against any candidates below that option, so you should only use RON if you feel the alternative really is that bad.

We'll be using our online voting platform, [UWCS Vote](https://vote.uwcs.co.uk). This will be open for 72 hours from the end of the AGM. Quorum is 33, so that many people need to vote on each position's election for it to count.

### Shared Office

Introduced in the 2022 AGM, Shared office is a clause in the constitution which reads as follows:

- 6.3.1 The newly elected executive committee can collectively vote to agree that specified
non-core offices should be shared among multiple individuals.
- 6.3.2 Further officers shall be selected by taking subsequent positions in the STV process,
until the required number of officers is reached.
	- 6.3.2.a This selection cannot pass a vote to Re-Open Nominations
	
In other words: the new exec can agree to choose multiple candidates for a position, in rank order of the STV results. I would personally recommend doing this for most positions.

### I WANT TO STAND

Send an email to [**president@uwcs.co.uk**](mailto:president@uwcs.co.uk) with the subject line "UWCS Elections" and the following information:

- Your student ID
- The position(s) you're standing for
- Whether you'll be there in-person or online
- Description (optional, max 100 words, per position)

### On the day

Each position will be discussed in turn:

1. A final call will be made for candidates to stand, before closing nominations for that position. 
2. All candidates will have the opportunity to give a 1-2 minute speech, without any other candidate in the room. You can say what you'd like, but we'd recommend talking about why you'd be a good fit for the position, and what you'd like to do. Slides are allowed, but aren't really necessary.
3. We will then open the floor to a Q&A. At first, the questions should not be targeted at any particular candidate, so all candidates can answer in turn. We estimate the Q&A for most positions to take around 5 minutes, but obviously the ones with more people are going to take longer.

# Motions

You can no longer submit constitution-changing motions. You can still submit motions that don't affect the constitution, but the society exec has no obligation to follow them even if passed.

[Current Constitution](../UWCS_constitution_23_24.pdf)

[Motion Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SvgtgYYuHPoti1gEcyHcsyNtp-4e-lssiEVDRJbfAkE/edit)

### On the day

Each motion will be read out by the returning officer (me), and time will be given for members to:

- Ask questions to the proposer/seconder
- Voice support for or opposition to the motion

### Voting

You can vote to support a motion, vote against a motion, or vote to abstain. If more people vote to support a motion than vote against, and at least 50 people have voted on it, the motion passes.

We'll be using our online voting platform, [UWCS Vote](https://vote.uwcs.co.uk). This will be open for 72 hours from the end of the AGM.
