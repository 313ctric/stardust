# Exec

This page (slightly confusingly) renders to https://uwcs.co.uk/contact, the name is to make it a bit more intuitive for referencing elsewhere.

This directory includes a list of all exec roles with description, roles, etc. You can edit these here and you should pull from this info to create other exec info pages.

Each follows the format:
```markdown
+++
title = "Exec Officer"
weight = <order>
date = "1970-01-01"

[extra]
people = ["First Last", "A Name"]
discords = ["@firstlast", "@discord"]
email = "rolename@uwcs.co.uk"
+++
<role description>
```

The `weight` field allows sorting the roles as expected (low numbers first).
