The main way to reach out to our society is via our general email, [exec@uwcs.co.uk](mailto:exec@uwcs.co.uk).
All current exec have access to this inbox, and we're always happy to hear about opportunities for our members.

If you're a current student and want to get involved with the society, we'd mainly recommend:

- Joining the inclusive and friendly community of current and former students on our Discord Server, across a variety of topic channels.
- Following our Instagram page, to keep up with our events via posts, and see behind the scenes with our stories.

You can find out more about the individual members of our exec committee here, but their emails can be found below:
