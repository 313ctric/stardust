The main way to reach out to our society is via our general email, [exec@uwcs.co.uk](mailto:exec@uwcs.co.uk).  
All current exec have access to this inbox, and we're always happy to hear about opportunities for/from our members.

If you're a current student and want to get involved with the society, we'd mainly recommend:

- Joining the inclusive and friendly community of current and former students on our <i class="bi bi-discord"></i> [Discord Server](https://discord.uwcs.co.uk), across a variety of topic channels.
- Following our <i class="bi bi-instagram"></i> [Instagram page](https://instagram.com/warwickcompsoc/), to keep up with our events via posts, and see behind the scenes with our stories.
