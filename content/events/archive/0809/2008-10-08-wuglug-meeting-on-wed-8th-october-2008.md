Haskell is a lazy, pure, functional programming language - which makes it interesting, but hard to get into. An introductory talk on haskell given by Richard Warburton (mulletron). Assumed knowledge is minimal. Possible pub visit afterwards. A0.23 is part of the business school complex - if you don't know where that is then people will be leaving DCS at 6.10
