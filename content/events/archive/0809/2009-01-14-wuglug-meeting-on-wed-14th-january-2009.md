After his successful Desktop Environments talk last term, Timothy Monks will be regaling us with an introductory talk on the python programming language. This is a heavily used programming language in the GNOME desktop environment. Entirely suitable for people with little linux knowledge, or those looking to expand their programming repertoire. Possible pub visit afterwards. A0.23 is part of the business school complex - if you don't know where that is then people will be leaving DCS at 6.45.
