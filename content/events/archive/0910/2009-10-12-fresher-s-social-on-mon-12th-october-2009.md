Come along to learn about who the current exec members are and what we do.

We will talk about past+upcoming events and you can feel free to ask any questions about the society or why monk's hair isn't pink.

At the end we will walk to get pubgrub, so make sure to come\!

MS04 is located in the Maths building (next to DCS), just go straight up the stairs as you come in and keep going up, MS04 is on the right.
