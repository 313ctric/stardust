The society is delighted to be hosting an academic talk by Google, presented by an ex-president Ruth King\! Ruth is a systems reliability engineer at Google, and will be delivering a talk on how Google engineers systems reliable for their use cases. After the talk we'll be heading over to the Phantom Coach for our weekly pub trip.
