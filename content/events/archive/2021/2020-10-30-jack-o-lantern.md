Replacing our weekly gaming session for this week, we're running our first weekend-long **virtual** LAN party\! We're gonna be hosting a range of activities across the weekends, including various tournaments, social gaming sessions and a quiz\! We'll be running our music server Amphi throughout so we can have synced audio playing too\! It'll all be on our [Discord server](http://discord.uwcs.co.uk/), so make sure to come along, no sign-ups are necessary\!
