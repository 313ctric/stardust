Laserquest, Yay\! If running around in a room trying to shoot your friends is your idea of fun then sign up now\! We will be going on Thursday in week 10 at 7.30 pm. Depeding on numbers we will be having between 2 and 4 games of laserquest each. Every game lasts for 20 minutes and costs Â£2 per person. We will be sorting out transport and teams once signups have closed (which is on Monday (27th) after the pub). By signing up to this event you are committing yourself to paying for the games whether you turn up or not as I will have to pay in advance.
