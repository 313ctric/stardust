Bowling\! YAY\! CompSoc will be descending upon Leamington so either lock your doors and hide or come and join in the fun\! We will be meeting in the Wetherspoons along the parade (The Benjamin Satchwell) at 6.30 pm for dinner and/or a drink and then moving on to MegaBowl for 9pm (tbc). Transport will be arranged closer to the event. By signing up to this event you are committing to paying Â£4 for two student games of bowling whether you come or not as I will have to pay in advance (Signups will close Friday 28th Oct wk 5). :o) If you have had a fear of bowling balls since you were a small child and would only like to come for dinner, please still join us, but make sure its clear you don't want booking for bowling\! I'm looking forward to seeing everyone there\! :o)
