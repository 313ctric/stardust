Every Tuesday and Friday from 7pm we're holding a virtual gaming session in our [Discord server](http://discord.gg/uwcs). To take part, just join our lobby text/voice channels (\#lobby-text).  
  
We have a variety of games we already play, however if you a new suggestion please do share it with us.
