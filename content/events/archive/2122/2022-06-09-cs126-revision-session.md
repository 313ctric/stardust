In this session for first year computer science students, we'll be running through content and questions from CS126 Design of Information Structures. This one was organised fairly last-minute, but we'll be trying to cover some of the later module topics, and ones requested by you\! Finally, we'll discuss some general tips for the exam. There'll also be snacks for those answering questions :)
