Happening from January 24th to February 7th, this university-wide game jam is a great incentive to get involved with development - whether you're a programmer or an artist, a musician or a level designer, get involved!

And not only that - there'll be speakers from the industry on various game development topics, and cash prizes for the winning teams!

In the opening keynote this Wednesday there will be more information about how it will all run, the rules, a chance to form teams and, of course, the theme (see second slide). 
If that sounds like your jam (pun intended), then sign up with the [link](tinyurl.com/wgj-24).

Let's make this one even bigger than last time...
