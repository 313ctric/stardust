Despite the fact most exams are done and people are leaving, we continue 𝕞𝕚𝕝𝕜 𝕞𝕠𝕟𝕕𝕒𝕪𝕤! If you are free, why not pass by and get some **free** milk?

**Every** Monday you can find a variety of milks available in the Department of Computer Science Atrium (plant-based options included). Come by, grab a cup, and have a little chat with some of us :)

*𝕄𝕚𝕝𝕜 is d̶e̶f̶i̶n̶i̶t̶e̶l̶y̶ proven to help you do better in your exams.*
