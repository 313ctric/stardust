It is term three and we are maintaining our newfound tradition of 𝕄𝕚𝕝𝕜 𝕄𝕠𝕟𝕕𝕒𝕪𝕤!

**Every** Monday you can find a variety of milks available in the Department of Computer Science Atrium (plant-based options included). Come by, grab a cup, and have a little chat with some of us :)

𝕄𝕚𝕝𝕜 is d̶e̶f̶i̶n̶i̶t̶e̶l̶y̶ proven to help you do better in your exams.

***Most importantly***, it is the *first* Monday of the month, so we will also be serving 𝒄𝒉𝒐𝒄𝒐𝒍𝒂𝒕𝒆 𝒎𝒊𝒍𝒌!
