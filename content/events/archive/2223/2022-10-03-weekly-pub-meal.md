Welcome to the start of term. Celebrate your first day of teaching with some food, while still staying on campus. Entertain any older years with your questionable modules choices, and maybe get some emergency advice. :P

  
Last week, I think we concerned the Phantom Coach's staff quite a lot with our numbers. So let's try scaring the Dirty Duck's staff as well\! It's closer too, what a win\!
