Introducing CompCafe ☕: designed to get people together! Every Tuesday, from 5pm onwards.

Whether you've got an upcoming deadline, need to work through some topics, want to bounce some ideas off people with work, or just hang out? This is for you!

We'll be providing snacks at every session, and will have people on hand if you need support with your studies. We're also planning to host other, smaller events there in future: keep an 👁️ out!
