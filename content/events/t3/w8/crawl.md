After the resounding success of the BBQ where you fatties consumed **80 burgers AND 80 hot-dogs** :scream::scream::scream: I've been given permission to run yet another Pub Traversal, this time in **Leamington Spa** (so RIP your wallets :money_with_wings: :money_with_wings: :money_with_wings:) and on a Sunday so you can cure your hangover from Skool Dayz with yet more alcohol. As a result we have prepared:
### The Ultimate ***Route***
Now lets take some time to talk about the ultimate ***route***, this ***route*** is most certainly a ***route***, if God himself sat down and thought "let's devise a ***route*** to rule all ***routes***" then this ***route*** would certainly be that ***route***. Rest assured that you will not be disappointed with the ***route*** and that means you have no:
### Excuses :middle_finger: :middle_finger: :middle_finger: 
Now lets take some time to talk about excuses, you honestly have no excuse not to come, if you don't come that is boring, you don't want to be called boring, very bad! If like me you can't answer any of them then there really is no excuse this time. We expect everyone to be here, if you don't it will be good to remember that there is a circle next week so...**WATCH OUT!** 

**TDLR**: It is gonna be awesome, you got sweet FA to do on a Sunday so why not?
