# :beer: The Pub Traversal :beer:
**🕘When:** Saturday 22nd Apr, from 7pm 'til we drop
**📍Where:** Bus Interchange

We are back with a vengeance this term with a pub traversal like no other! One, two, or even three pubs? **FAT CHANCE** - we're gonna hit **7 :scream:** because why settle for anything less? :thinking::thinking::thinking:

Join the **CHAOS** at the Bus Interchange at 7pm sharp, as we embark on our heroic voyage: starting at the Oak Inn and finishing at spoons, Coventry won't know what hit 'em. Get ready for a night so unbelievably good you'll be questioning if you've dropped dead already :melting_face:

Whether you do not do this very often, or a seasoned regular, prepare for this to be certainly one of the events of the year. Do not miss out!
