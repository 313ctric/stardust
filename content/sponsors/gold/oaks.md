The Oaks is a student accommodation in Coventry with more brand new rooms for 2022. Situated less than a 10-minute walk from the University of Warwick and the only purpose-built student accommodation next to Warwickâ€™s 750-acre main campus on the outskirts of Coventry, the accommodation is a popular choice among Warwick students. The Oaks Coventry combines the best of campus living within studio and en-suite rooms and easy transport links to and from nearby places of interest Coventry, Warwick, and Leamington Spa. Why look anywhere else? After selling out early in 2021, we have now expanded to meet demand with brand new blocks for September 2022, featuring amazing spaces including a gym, games area, TV room, hosting kitchen, yoga room and more. Sound good? Book early to avoid disappointment and live right by campus!
